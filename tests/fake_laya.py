"""A `laya` that loads no weights.

The in-process decision LLM is the one backend with no wire between quackd and the model, so
the only way to test the seam is to stand where the model would be. Installed into
`sys.modules` for the life of one test, because the real package pulls torch and a suite that
imported it would be testing a download.

What it stands in for is the shape rather than the answer: `Router(...)` takes its keywords and
remembers them, `predict(state, questions, model=...)` records what it was asked and hands back
whatever the test scripted, and the return is a plain mapping in the shape `laya.agent` really
builds -- a hardcoded `model`, the `answers`, a `usage` carrying a real input count and a
hardcoded zero output, and the `routing` block `Router.predict` adds. That count is the reason
this row is costed measured rather than estimated, so a fake without it would have the suite
proving the wrong branch.
