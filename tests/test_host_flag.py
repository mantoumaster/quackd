"""`--host`: which board a command uses, where that was said, and what one board cannot be.

The noun is one machine: its model server, its camera, its detector and its health. These
tests hold the parts that exist before any of the board's data is read: the order the three
places that can name a board are tried in, the refusal of a fleet (one board cannot be every
member's camera), the local preset moving to the board, and the token staying out of every
record a run writes. The client and the daemon are tested in their own files.

Nothing here has touched a Jetson. Where a daemon has to be listening, it is the fake in
`tests/fake_jetson_hostd.py`, which proves quackd reads the protocol and nothing about a board.
