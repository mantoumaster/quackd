"""`quackd preflight`: task files rehearsed on the arm's simulator, and judged by its truth.

What is refused before anything is built comes first, and needs no physics: a robot that is not
a simulator, a registered real arm and the mock among them, and a pilot nobody named. Then the
sidecar, `<task>.sim.yaml`, read and refused as a person would write it, and each check judged
against synthetic truths and transcripts. The runs themselves are last, on the stand-in arm with
the scripted pilot typed in full: a run that passes, one whose predicates fail, the JSON the
same report makes, and the same seed giving the same report twice. Those skip without the
physics extra or a GL context, unless `QUACKD_REQUIRE_GL=1` says they must not.

No number here comes off an arm. The calibration is synthetic, built from the stand-in's own
ranges with ids out of the bus table's order, a joint's move is a share of the travel that
calibration gives it, and each threshold is set against what the run itself can reach.
