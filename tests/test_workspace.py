"""Eight packages are released together, so nothing about them may drift apart.

quackd is one repository and eight distributions now: the core and one per robot. That buys
an install with no robot in it, and it costs a set of facts that have to agree and that no
single file owns. A version in eight places, a catalogue in the core that names seven
adapters none of which it imports, an entry point in each of those seven, and a dependency
window in both directions. Every one of those is a thing somebody can half-update.
