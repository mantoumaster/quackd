"""Which detector a run uses, who chose it, and where the run says so.

The policy: the board's detector is used by itself only on a real body whose `--host` daemon can
detect, never on a simulator; `--detector color` opts out, `--detector host` is honoured even on
a simulator, and `--detector yolo` runs YOLO on this machine. A choice that cannot run here is
refused before anything connects, as is a `--host` whose daemon does not answer. The header, the
record and the MCP server all name the detector.

The board is the fake daemon in `tests/fake_jetson_hostd.py`; nothing here has seen a Jetson.
