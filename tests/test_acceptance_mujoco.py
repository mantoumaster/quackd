"""The sim2d acceptance sweep, on the physics simulator: with the scripted pilot,
`find-and-kick` succeeds on seeds 0..9, and the world's own ball telemetry agrees.

Twice: once on the kinematic stand-in, which is what a runner with the physics extra can
always do, and once on upstream's own trained gait, which needs the model in the cache and so
is marked `real_duck`. The second is the one the README's claim rests on, and it exists
because that claim had no test behind it at all.

Skipped without `quackd[mujoco]` or without an OpenGL context, because the composite verbs
steer on rendered frames and there is nothing to steer on without one.
