"""The arm's simulator on the SO-101's own model, the one a rehearsal runs on: whether it can
hold what a task asks it to hold, and whether it runs a task end to end.

Every test here is marked `so101_model`. The maker's model is fetched at run time and never
shipped, and CI's gating jobs fetch nothing, so these skip wherever it is not already fetched.
The nightly `lerobot-sim-assets` job fetches it at its pin the way a first run would and runs
them there; a developer runs them against the cache, or against a checkout named by
`QUACKD_LEROBOT_SIM_ASSETS`.

- **The grasp sweep.** On each seed a cube is laid somewhere on the table, and the arm is driven
  through the real backend's own verbs to open over it, come down around it, close and lift.
  Where to put the joints is worked out from where the cube lies, through the loaded model's own
  kinematics, since only the model knows where its fingers are. The world's truth is the judge:
  the cube off the table and touching both pads. quackd's own verdict, the gripper settling
  inside `HOLD_MIN` and `HOLD_MAX`, is recorded beside it and printed, and never asserted:
  whether it agrees with a real gripper is a question for the bench.
- **The acceptance sweep.** The bundled arm lookout and a grasp task with a sidecar, each
  rehearsed seed after seed through `quackd preflight`'s own loop.
- **The cameras.** The real meshes drawn from the front and from the wrist.
- **The physics against the wall.** With nothing rendering, the model steps faster than real
  time, which is what lets a rehearsal cost less than the run it rehearses.

No number here comes off an arm. Where an object lies comes from the seed, where the fingers are
from the model's own meshes, and the travel from the generic arm's calibration, which is built
from the model's own ranges.

    are worked out through the model as the grasp sweep works its out, over the generic arm's
