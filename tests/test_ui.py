"""The house style: what it draws, what it refuses to parse, and when it stands down.

Three promises are worth a test each. Text a model or a manifest wrote is never read as
markup. A stream that cannot carry a glyph gets an ASCII one rather than a `?`. And the
status line exists only when somebody is watching, because everything this project prints
also has to survive a pipe, a test runner and a CI log.

A fourth came with the capture: what you saw is written into the run directory, and a file
somebody reads a year later must hold the run's own lines, none of Rich's scaffolding,
nothing that drives the terminal they read it in, and a word about itself if it is short.
