"""A policy server from the command line to the record: the flags, the factory, the goal duck,
the pilot's prompt and the run's policy block.

`--policy-url` and `--policy-token` reach the arm through `make_adapter(policy=...)`, which the
LeRobot adapter turns into the client of the server (`RemoteRunner`) and every other body
refuses, and through `describe(policy=...)`, which lets a task that allows `manipulate` be
judged before anything connects. The server here is the real one, in-process on loopback,
serving a scripted policy, as in `tests/test_policy_contract.py`, and the end-to-end run is
`quackd run --goal` on `lerobot:mujoco` over the stand-in model with the scripted pilot taught
to call `manipulate` once.

No number here comes off an arm: the travel is the stand-in's generic calibration, the policy
is `scripted:hold`, and every figure checked is one the run itself counted.
