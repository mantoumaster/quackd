"""The board's YOLO as a `Detector`: `quackd.perception.host.HostDetector`.

Driven against the fake daemon in `tests/fake_jetson_hostd.py` over real HTTP on loopback, and
beside `YoloDetector` with a fake `ultralytics` standing in for the model, so the claim that the
same boxes are the same detections on either machine is a comparison and not a recollection.
None of it says anything about a Jetson, which no test here has seen.
