"""The policy loop: a named rate, pacing on the arm's clock, a derived speed cap and chunks.

Every segment here runs the real backend over the test suite's `FakeArm`, on the synthetic
`SPANS` calibration and the `REWIRED` motor table, so no travel, id or tick of any arm is in it.
The rates are the verbs' own (`TICK_S`) or a multiple of it, and every limit is read off the
loop's own constants. Time is a clock that moves only when it is slept, so a segment of many
seconds costs none of the wall's, and every tick lands where the pacer put it.

Two clocks stand in for the two kinds the loop tells apart. `LockstepClock` says it is lockstep,
as the simulator's does, so inference is awaited in the loop's turn and each chunk is held back
by the runner's declared latency. `GateClock` is the wall's kind, where an answer comes back
whenever the runner's thread has it: here it opens a gated runner's answer exactly `k` ticks
after it was asked, which is a runner that takes `k` ticks, on a clock a test can repeat.
