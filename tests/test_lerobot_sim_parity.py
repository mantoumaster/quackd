"""The real backend over two arms: the fake its tests are written against, and the simulator.

`lerobot:mujoco` runs `lerobot:real`'s own code over `SimFollower`, so whatever that backend
promises about an arm has to hold over the simulated follower as it holds over `FakeArm`. Each
test here runs once over each, with the same synthetic calibration, the same step cap (the
fake's `step`, the follower's `max_relative_target`), the same starting pose and a clock that
moves only when it is slept, which for the simulator also steps the physics by the time slept.
A behaviour that holds over one and not the other is a gap between the fake and the arm the
simulator models, and it is found here rather than on the bench.

One behaviour differs on purpose. What a servo does with its stored goal when torque comes back
is unverified (`upstream_api.TORQUE_ENABLE_HOLDS_PRESENT`): the fake holds where it stands, the
best case, and the simulator drives to the goal it was last written, the worst. The test of it
runs over the simulator alone, and shows the take-hold's order is what keeps the worst case off
a person's hand.

The seeded faults run over the simulator alone. A fake is told what to raise; the point of a
seed is that nobody tells the simulator, and the real backend still says what happened.

No number here comes off an arm. The travel is a share of the stand-in's own stops, which are
the manifest's joint limit, the cap is quackd's own default step, and the motor ids are
upstream's bus table in another order. Nothing is fetched: the arm is the stand-in.
