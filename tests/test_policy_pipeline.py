"""The LeRobot pipeline the policy server loads a checkpoint through, and a checkpoint run in it.

Two halves. The first reads what a checkpoint says about itself, with no torch anywhere: the
JSON it is checked by, the order it is fetched in so that nothing that could run code arrives
before the JSON that names it has been checked, the models it names inside itself, where its
rate comes from, and what the build is told. These run in the default suite, over a fake Hub.

The second is CI's torch job (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `policy`): a tiny random ACT, built
here with no pretrained backbone and saved naming LeRobot's default one, both processors saved,
put in a Hub cache of its own at a commit and a tag, and served with the Hub and torchvision
offline by the real server to the real client and an arm behind it. It is skipped where torch
or LeRobot is missing, unless `QUACKD_REQUIRE_TORCH` is set, as it is in that job, where a
missing one fails the run rather than leaving it green having loaded nothing. It is what moves
POLICY_PIPELINE to VERIFIED (`policy/upstream_api.py`), for ACT on the CPU and nothing else,
and a random policy says nothing about what a trained one does to an arm.
