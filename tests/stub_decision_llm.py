"""A third party's decision LLM, as one would actually ship.

This is the whole contract a plugin has to meet, and it is short on purpose: the point of the
entry point group is that quackd never has to know about you. A real one would declare itself
in its own `pyproject.toml`:

    [project.entry-points."quackd.decision_llms"]
    stub = "tests.stub_decision_llm"

and `tests/test_decision.py` stands in for that declaration by monkeypatching `entry_points`,
because installing a distribution mid-suite is not a thing a test should do.
