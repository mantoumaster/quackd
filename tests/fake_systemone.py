"""A System One server that never leaves the machine.

Two faces, because the seam it stands in for is now two seams. Installed into `sys.modules` as
`typesafe_sdk`, it is the SDK `quackd.agent.decision.systemone` imports lazily and would
otherwise find whatever state a developer's machine happens to be in and nothing at all on CI,
which is two different suites. Handed straight to `Stepper.build` as `llm=`, it is a
`DecisionLLM` and the HTTP half is never involved at all -- which is what most of the stepper's
own tests want, because what they are testing is the gates rather than the transport.

The shapes are the ones docs.typesafe.ai publishes and every compatible server implements:
`system_one` takes a state and a mapping of question name to question, and the result has an
`answers` mapping whose members carry `choice`, `confidence` and `probabilities`, or a bare
`noul`. Nothing here is a model: the answers are whatever the test scripted, which is the
point.
