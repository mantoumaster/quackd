"""`--controller vla`: a scripted pilot that hands the arm's learned policy each instruction and
leaves the task to the person who watched it.

The loop's half runs on the LeRobot mock, whose `manipulate` is a scripted segment on a clock of
its own, so every segment runs exactly the seconds it was told and a budget ends a list where the
arithmetic says. The command's half is `quackd run --controller vla` on `lerobot:mujoco` over the
simulator's stand-in model, against the real policy server serving `scripted:hold`, with the
terminal's answers scripted through `_ask`.

The person is always an asker marked `asks_a_person`, as the CLI marks its own, and every
refusal is checked to stop before a run directory exists.
