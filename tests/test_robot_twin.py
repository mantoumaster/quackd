"""`quackd robot twin`: a simulator of a registered arm, registered beside it.

The twin is `lerobot:mujoco` on the calibration file the arm's own runs read, found where
LeRobot keeps it under the arm's registered name, with the arm's rest pose, pilot and camera
urls copied as they were recorded, except a camera the simulator does not render, which is left
out and said. What it is refused for, each in a sentence: a name that is the source's own, a
source that is not a registered LeRobot arm, a name already taken, which `--force` replaces only
where it is already a simulator, no calibration file to read, and a serial port where the
calibration file goes, which nothing opens or looks for.

Nothing here connects anything or needs the physics. The registry and LeRobot's calibration
directory are the suite's temporary ones (`tests/conftest.py`), and no number here comes off an
arm: the calibration is built from the encoder's tick count and upstream's bus table, with ids
out of the table's order, and the rest pose puts one joint below its travel and one above it,
which a twin copies as recorded rather than clipped.
