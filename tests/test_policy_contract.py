"""The two halves of the policy protocol, talking to each other, and the arm's loop behind one.

The server here is the real one (`quackd_lerobot.policy.server`), in-process on port 0 on
loopback, serving a scripted policy by the name `quackd policy serve --policy scripted:NAME`
takes, and the client is the real `RemoteRunner`. So a field renamed on one side, a shape one
side sends and the other refuses, or a bound one side moved is caught here, and the segments
below run the real policy loop over the backend and the test suite's `FakeArm`, through HTTP,
end to end. It runs in-process rather than as a subprocess for the reason the Jetson daemon's
contract test gives: subprocess servers flake on this project's Windows machine.

What it cannot catch is anything about a checkpoint, which needs torch: CI's torch job loads a
tiny one through this same server in `tests/test_policy_pipeline.py`. What the arm's side
checks of a policy at connect (`fit.py`) is here, against a server that says what a checkpoint
would say about itself, since the check reads only what the server says.
