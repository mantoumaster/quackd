"""The command somebody typed, written down without the secrets in it.

A run's record said what quackd did and never what it was asked to do. The flags are half the
story of any run: which robot, which model, which budget, whether it was a dry run, what the
task was called. Reading a transcript a month later and having to guess at them is the same
gap the wall clock had, and it is closed the same way, by writing the thing down once at the
top.

Secrets reach that line by more routes than one, and those are the reason this is a module
rather than a line. `--api-key` and `--token` carry one outright, a URL flag carries one in
its userinfo or its query string, and `--extra-body` carries one in whatever field a vendor
asked for. A run directory is pasted into issues, attached to bug reports and copied off a
bench machine, and a key that reaches one is a key that has to be rotated.
