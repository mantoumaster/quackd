"""The pilot's word on whether the body can do the task, and the vocabulary it says it in.

Every other gate in quackd refuses one verb. This one refuses *all motion* until the model
has said, against the datasheet in its prompt, whether the task fits the body it is driving.
The verdict is the model's own judgement and is recorded as such: what it estimated, what it
read, and what the task would need, so a transcript shows the reasoning rather than only the
refusal.

`needs` is the one vocabulary three readers share: the tool schema the model fills in, the
matcher that says which other body could, and a flock role that asks for a body that can
carry. A number is a minimum (a working height is a point inside a band), a word must match,
and a figure the maker never published is not met: a robot that cannot say what it carries is
not offered a task that carries something. `missing_needs_in` carries the four exceptions to
that last rule, and the one place a pilot judging its own body is read more kindly than a
coordinator judging a stranger's bid, and says why it has each of them.

A pilot has to be able to look at the thing before judging whether it can lift it. Everything
else waits, including a verb quackd has never heard of: the gate reads this set and one
other thing, the verb's own `read_only` flag, so a body quackd has never shipped can still
say "this one only looks" about its own sensing verbs. A learned verb never carries that
flag (`learned.py` registers it as `confirm`, unproven), and the gate excludes a learned verb
from this set by name as well, so an unproven policy called `observe` waits like everything
else until somebody classifies it on purpose.

This half is matched by name, which makes the nine a vocabulary rather than a list: a body

    `facts` is a datasheet dumped to a dict, which is what a flock bid carries, so a
    coordinator can judge a bid from a robot it does not run. A figure nobody published is
    unmet rather than assumed. The reader and the text the pilot reads have to agree, or a
    pilot is refused for doing as it was told, so there are four exceptions, each of which
    would otherwise refuse an honest answer:

    - A zero asks for nothing, for every number. The tool asks the pilot to fill `needs` in
      even when the verdict is feasible and to give 0 for what the task does not turn on, so
      `payload_kg: 0` is how a pilot says the task carries nothing. `work_height_m: 0` used to
      be read as "the ground", which is below the one working height band quackd ships and
      unpublished everywhere else, so a pilot that did as it was told was refused on every
      body. A task whose hands really work at the floor says so with a height above zero.
    - `none` for `mobility` or `manipulator` asks for nothing: no locomotion, nothing held.
    - An unpublished terrain meets `indoor_flat` on a body that moves and has a datasheet,
      because the prompt tells exactly that body to assume a flat indoor floor.
    - A body that does not move, and has a datasheet, meets `indoor_flat` and nothing above it:
      it stands on whatever floor its table stands on, and the prompt says "it does not move"
      where a moving body is told its terrain. It is refused as "(it does not move)", which is
      the fact the pilot was shown, rather than "(not published)", which it never was.

    A body with no datasheet at all gets none of the floor exceptions: its prompt says to treat
    every physical limit as not published, terrain included, and a bid that carried no sheet
    said nothing. `mobility` comes in apart from `facts` because it lives on the manifest.

    `own_sheet` is the one place a pilot judging its own body is read more kindly than anybody
    judging a stranger's. With it, a `work_height_m` against a sheet that publishes no working
    height band is not refused: the prompt never lists a working height as a gap
    (`Datasheet.FIGURES` leaves it out on purpose), so the pilot had no way to know it was one
    and is judging a height against the height and reach it was shown. The verdict gate
    (`own_sheet_objection`) and `solo_hint`'s last sentence about the pilot's own body read it
    that way.
    Everything that names a body to hand a task to reads it strictly, which is the default:
    `bodies_that_could`, the MCP `could` list, a flock role and the coordinator judging a bid.
    There an unknown is not a yes, and a body that never said how high it works is not the one
    to offer a task at a height. A body with no datasheet is told height is not published, so
    it gets no leniency either way."""
