"""Meta as the duck's brain, over the Meta Model API.

Not Llama. Meta retired the hosted Llama API in July 2026 and what stands at
`https://api.meta.ai/v1` now serves Muse Spark, drop-in compatible with the OpenAI SDK. The
catalogue carries the model names, including the contributor-tier ones, whose labels say plainly
that the discount is paid for by letting Meta train on what you send.

`tool_choice` is left at `auto`, the only value Meta's tool-calling page accepts (`none`,
`required` and a named choice each return a 400), so the model is allowed a call rather than
made to make one. `parallel_tool_calls=False` is sent, which the same page documents as the way
to get one call per turn; its default is to allow several.

The key is read from `META_API_KEY`, then `MODEL_API_KEY`, which is the name Meta's own examples
export.
