"""Claude as the duck's brain, via the official `anthropic` SDK (optional extra).

Written against `anthropic` 1.x: adaptive thinking is the model's default on Claude Opus 5 and
later, and the request asks for `display: "summarized"` because the default display leaves
every thinking block's text empty, which would make the log's "what it thought" a blank line.
`display` changes what is shown, never what is thought or billed. A model that rejects the
`thinking` parameter (one older than Claude 4.6) gets one retry without it, and the run goes
on without thinking text. `output_config.effort` is sent to every model that takes it, which is
every row but Haiku 4.5 and Sonnet 4.5 (`ModelSpec.effort`).

`tool_choice={"type": "any", "disable_parallel_tool_use": True}` guarantees exactly one tool
call per turn on every model that accepts a forced call. Claude
Opus 5.5 and Claude Fable 5.1 do not, and answer one with a 400, so the catalogue marks them
(`ModelSpec.forced_tools`) and they are asked with `auto` instead, still one call per turn; a
model the catalogue does not mark gets one retry with `auto` when it says the same thing, and
keeps it. Images ride as base64 PNG blocks, and the assistant's raw content blocks (including
thinking) are replayed verbatim on the next turn. Server-side refusal fallbacks are on by
default and drop out automatically if the installed SDK predates them; a turn one of them took
records the model that answered it (`ProviderTurn.served_by`).
