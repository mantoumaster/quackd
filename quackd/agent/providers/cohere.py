"""Cohere as the duck's brain, over its OpenAI compatibility endpoint.

Cohere's compatibility layer takes `tools` but documents neither `tool_choice` nor
`parallel_tool_calls` among the parameters it supports, so quackd sends neither. That makes Cohere
the one vendor here that cannot be *told* to call a tool, only asked: a turn that comes back as
prose costs the loop its one re-prompt. It is the vendor's surface, not a setting to tune.

The key is read from `COHERE_API_KEY`, and from `CO_API_KEY` after that, because Cohere's own SDK
and its docs disagree about which one a reader will already have exported.
