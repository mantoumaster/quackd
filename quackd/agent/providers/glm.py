"""GLM as the duck's brain, over Z.ai's OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

Z.ai's function-calling page is explicit where the others are silent: `tool_choice` defaults to
`auto` and `auto` is the only value it supports. So `auto` is not a cautious guess here, it is the
whole vocabulary, and quackd asks for a tool call rather than requiring one.
