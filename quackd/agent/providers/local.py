"""Local and open-source models as the duck's brain: llama.cpp, vLLM, Ollama, LM Studio.

They all speak OpenAI's Chat Completions format, so this is the OpenAI provider with the
knobs turned for servers that are pickier and models that are weaker at tool calling:
no key needed, a preset base URL per server, `tool_choice="auto"` and no
`parallel_tool_calls` field, vision off unless asked, model discovery from `/v1/models`,
and a text fallback that rescues a tool call a small model wrote as plain JSON.

A preset's address can move to another machine with `--host` (`on_host`), which is how a
model served on a Jetson's GPU is reached from the laptop without typing its URL.
