"""Mistral as the duck's brain, over its OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

One difference worth the file: Mistral's function-calling guide documents `any` as its word for
"you must call a tool", so that is what quackd sends, although its API spec lists OpenAI's
`required` as well. Sending nothing is a model free to answer in prose, which for quackd is a
turn thrown away.
`parallel_tool_calls` it does accept, so that stays.
