"""Grok as the duck's brain: xAI's OpenAI-compatible endpoint, so it is the OpenAI provider with
a different base URL, key and model list. Nothing else changes.

xAI documents both `tool_choice="required"` and `parallel_tool_calls`, so the strict settings the
base class uses for OpenAI are right here too, and quackd gets its one call per turn asked for
rather than hoped for.
