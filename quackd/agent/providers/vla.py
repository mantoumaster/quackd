"""`--controller vla`: a scripted pilot that hands the arm's learned policy one subtask at a time
and leaves the task itself to the person who watched it.

A vision-language-action policy is good at contact and says nothing about the task it was given:
it has no judgement of the body, no report of the table between segments, and no notion of done.
So this pilot claims none of those either:

- **Its verdict is `uncertain`, always.** A person decides whether this body should try the task
  at all (`RunConfig.decide`), and a run with nobody to decide it ends there.
- **It calls `manipulate` once per instruction, in order.** The task file's
  `policy.instructions`, or the `--goal` text as the only one. Each goes through the same
  narrowed verb, executor and budget as any pilot's call, so the list, the confirm gate and
  `total_s` hold for it too.
- **It declares from a person's answer.** After the last segment the loop asks whether the arm
  did it (`RunConfig.judge`) and puts the answer on the next observation (`JUDGE_FEATURE`). A
  yes from a person really asked is success. A no, an answer no person gave, a prompt that
  raised before anybody answered, nobody to ask, or a segment that did not end ok is failure.

What it reads is the observation's `last_result` and that answer, and nothing else: never the
simulator's own truth about the table, which `quackd preflight` judges on its own. It calls no
model, so it spends no tokens and is priced as the scripted pilot is, at nothing
(`providers.pricing`).
