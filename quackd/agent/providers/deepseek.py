"""DeepSeek as the duck's brain, over its OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

DeepSeek thinks by default, and thinking mode refuses both halves of how quackd asks. Its
request reference says "`required` and named tool choices are not supported in thinking mode;
the API returns a `400` error", and its thinking-mode guide says that a request carrying `tools`
must send every earlier turn's `reasoning_content` back, or it is a 400 too. So quackd turns
thinking off (`thinking: {"type": "disabled"}`, sent through the request body the way
`--extra-body` is, and overridable from there) and asks for its one call with `required`, which
non-thinking mode accepts. Turning thinking back on with `--extra-body` brings both refusals
back, and nothing here replays `reasoning_content`. `parallel_tool_calls` is not in DeepSeek's
request reference, and an unknown field is a 400 on some gateways, so it is not sent: the loop
already takes the first call when a model sends more.
