"""Pictures that come with the task: `quackd run --image sketch.png`.

A camera frame is perception and arrives every step. One of these is neither: it is a file a
person named on the command line, it is fixed for the whole run, and it is what the task is
about. "Draw what is in the picture" is not a sentence a robot's own camera can answer.

Everything here is re-encoded to PNG before it goes anywhere. Every provider quackd speaks to
already takes a PNG, `NamedPng` promises one, and the copy kept beside the transcript is then
byte for byte what the model was sent rather than a source file it was derived from. The cost
is that a photograph is re-compressed on its way in, which is also where it is made small
enough to send.
