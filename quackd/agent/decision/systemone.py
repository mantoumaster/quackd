"""Every decision LLM that speaks `POST /v1/systemone`, over one client.

TypeSafe published the format and the client; Kev, Von, OpenJev, OpenDecision and the rest
implement it and document the same sentence -- point the SDK at our base URL. So this is one
class with a row of data in front of it rather than a module per vendor, and a server quackd
has never heard of is `--decision-llm local --decision-url` and no code at all.

`typesafe_sdk` is the transport for all of them because it is the protocol's reference client:
it owns the retry policy, the typed errors and the `int | None` usage the billing already
reads tolerantly. The extra that installs it is named `decision` rather than for the vendor
for exactly that reason.

Imported only when a run has named one of these. Nothing at module scope touches the SDK.
