Three flags and four variables resolve here, in one place, so that a refusal can name where a
value came from: a flag somebody has just typed and a line in a `.env` they have forgotten
want different sentences. Nothing in this module imports a backend until a run has named one,

call away and are reached only from `make_decision_llm`.

`quackd doctor` can ask "which decision LLMs could run here?" without paying for any of them.
