"""Laya, in this process: a decision LLM with no server, no network and no key.

The other presets are servers and share a client. This one is an encoder you import, and it
earns its own file for one reason: it is the proof that the seam here is a protocol rather
than an HTTP call. Everything quackd asks of a decision LLM it asks of this one too, and the
questions that go to a hosted API go to this unchanged, because Laya's own `predict` takes the
same `{"type": ..., "instructions": ..., "criteria": ...}` mapping the wire format does.

What it returns beside the answers is a real token count, `int(attention_mask.sum())` for
the input and a hardcoded zero for the output, so a turn it answers is recorded measured
rather than estimated. It still costs nothing, because a checkpoint in this process is
charged at the self-hosted rate: it billed you in electricity.

Imported only when a run has named it. `torch` is not something `quackd --help` may pay for.
