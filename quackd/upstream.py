"""How quackd cites an upstream project, in one place that belongs to no robot.

Every adapter records the names it relies on as `UpstreamRef`s, tagged VERIFIED (read from
upstream source at a pinned commit, link given) or UNVERIFIED (designed upstream but not
shipped, or an assumption of ours, with what quackd does about it). ADR-0022 is why each
adapter keeps its own file of them rather than sharing one list.

This type used to live in the Microduck's own `upstream_api.py`, which made every other
adapter import the Microduck to describe a robot that has nothing to do with it. It is the
one thing in that file that was never about ducks.
