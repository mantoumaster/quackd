"""`quackd preflight`: task files rehearsed on the arm's simulator before they meet the arm.

A task file nobody has run is a guess, and the arm is where a wrong guess costs most: a bus that
loses a packet in the middle of a connect, a rest pose past the calibrated travel, a pilot that
reaches for a verb the file never allowed. `lerobot:mujoco` runs the real backend's own code
over a physics model, so a file rehearsed on it runs through the lines that will drive the arm.
This is that rehearsal, done the same way every time.

For each file, in this order:

1. The task is checked against the robot's static manifest, as `quackd validate` checks it, and
   its sidecar is read (below).
2. The simulator is connected and closed `DEFAULT_CONNECT_CYCLES` times, cycle k on seed k with
   the `--faults` plan, if one was given, drawing its bus faults. An error that escapes any of
   them fails the file, and no run is made on a robot that cannot be connected. Under a plan, a
   connect that retried and then gave up in words is what the arm's connect does when a bus
   drops too much, and it is noted rather than failed: the runs after it connect with no
   faults, so a robot that cannot be connected at all still fails every one of them.
3. The task is run once per seed through the agent loop, memory off, in a loop of this module's
   own rather than `quackd run`'s, because what a run is judged by is on the transport after the
   run has ended and the command does not hand its transport back.

A run passes when nothing escaped it, no call to the simulated bus was left hanging, its close
ended at the rest pose, or refused where the sidecar says to expect that, and every check in the
sidecar holds. The pilot's own verdict is reported and is not one of those: a model that says it
succeeded is the thing being rehearsed, not the judge of it.

The sidecar is `<task>.sim.yaml` beside the task file, and never the file's frontmatter, because
`robot_load_duckfile` hands an MCP pilot the whole frontmatter, and a pilot that can read what it
will be marked on is rehearsing the marking. It says what to lay on the table and what has to be
so afterwards:

    scene:
      objects:
        - {name: block, kind: box, size: [0.0125, 0.0125, 0.0125], place: jaws}
    checks:
      - at_rest: true
      - joint_moved: {joint: shoulder_lift, min_deg: 10}
      - lifted: {object: block, min_m: 0.02, when: peak}
      - moved: {object: block, min_m: 0.05, when: latched}

Every threshold is the task's own, and is measured from the run's start: a joint from its first
observed reading, in the degrees its calibration gives, and an object from where it was laid.
Joint checks read the transcript, which is what the pilot was shown. Object checks read the
world's truth as the simulator latched it on the way into the teardown's stop, before the rest
move carried the arm back through the scene (`latched`), or the most the object reached before
then (`peak`). Never the live world, which the rest move has been through by the time anything
reads it, and never the state's extras, which reach the pilot and MCP.

Refused before anything is built: a robot that is not a simulator, which `quackd robot twin`
makes of a registered arm, and a pilot nobody named, because the scripted pilot rehearses
nothing a model would do and so runs only when `--llm fake` is typed.

Nothing here imports the simulator. The robot is built through the factory, and what a run is
judged by is read off the transport it built, by name.
