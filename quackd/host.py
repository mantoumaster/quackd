"""The laptop's half of the Jetson host daemon's protocol: a board quackd uses and never runs on.

`--host jetson.local` names a machine, not a body; `--robot` still names the body. quackd stays
on the laptop and reaches the board over plain HTTP, through the one small daemon it ships for
it, `bridge/jetson/quackd_jetson_hostd.py`, the way it ships a camera daemon for the Open Duck
Mini's Pi. What the daemon offers is the board's own health, a camera if one is plugged in, and
a YOLO detector on the board's GPU. This module is the client for all of it and the only place
on this side that spells the wire protocol. The daemon spells the same constants, and a change
to either end is a change to both.

It is synchronous on purpose. `doctor` and the CLI call it directly, and the two consumers
inside a run (the host camera and the host detector) call it through `asyncio.to_thread`, the
way the Open Duck bridge fetches its frames, so a slow board costs one bounded wait and never
stalls the event loop that keeps a body's keepalives flowing. Every call has a timeout sized to
what it does, so a daemon that died costs one window and never a hang. Looking up the board's
name is outside every one of them: the system resolver does it on its own clock, before there is
a socket to time out, so a name that stops resolving can cost more than the window, on every call,
since each one looks it up again. An address given to `--host` is never looked up.

It imports the standard library and PIL and nothing else, because `doctor` and the CLI import
it on every invocation and neither should pay more than that to learn a board is not there.

The token rides in one header and nowhere else. Not in a URL, because URLs are what proxies,
access logs and pasted error messages keep; not in any error this module raises, its message
or its payload; not in a repr. Proxies are bypassed and redirects are refused for the same
reason: either one would hand the header to a machine that is not the board.

Nothing in this module has been run against a Jetson by this project. Its tests drive it against
a fake of the protocol on loopback (`tests/fake_jetson_hostd.py`), which proves quackd reads the
protocol as written and says nothing about a board.

    beats no board at all. The robot beats the environment because it was registered by a
    person who meant it, and a variable in a shell was not necessarily meant for this robot.

    The token has a ladder of its own: `--host-token`, else the robot's stored `host_token`,
