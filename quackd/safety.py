"""The layer that does not trust the LLM.

Upstream's `robotd` is the safety authority for the robot's body. This module is the
authority for the *conversation*: every verb call — from the agent loop or an MCP client —
passes through `Executor`, which checks the `.duck` allowlist, asks a human when the
contract says so, counts budgets, and can run with the transport disconnected (`dry_run`).
`Heartbeat` and the kill switch make "the LLM stalled" and "the human panicked" both end in
a `stop` intent.
