"""One pilot's end of the flock bus: what it hears, what it says, what it is told about
the others.

A pilot flock does not have a referee. Nobody assigns the work, nobody judges the result, and
the only thing keeping two robots from both doing the same half of a task is that they said
what they were going to do. That makes this module small and load-bearing: a `tell` tool, a
`TALK` message, and a paragraph in every pilot's prompt naming its peers and what their bodies
are (ADR-0034).

The peer paragraph is the part that is not obvious. A pilot deciding who fetches and who holds
needs the *other* robot's datasheet, not only its own, and it gets exactly the one-paragraph
form its own prompt uses for itself, so the two are read in the same words. It is the static
manifest, so building this costs no connection.

Nothing here awaits the bus, for the reason `quackd/flock/bus.py` gives: publish is a
synchronous fan-out and a reader drains between turns.

and all of you are working at the same time. Nobody is in charge and nothing assigns the work:
you divide it between you by saying what you will do.

The others:
{others}

Read those the way you read your own body above, because that is the same paragraph: what each
one can carry, reach and do, and what it cannot do at all. Use it to work out which part of the
task is yours and which is somebody else's.

Talking: call `tell` with `to` (a name above, or `{EVERYONE}`) and a short `text`. It reaches
them in their next observation, moves nothing and costs no step. Say what you are about to do
before you do it, and say when you are done, so nobody waits on you. What they say to you
arrives under "Messages from your flock"; you never hear your own words back, and a message
from `{FLOCK_SRC}` is the run itself telling you that somebody has finished or stopped.

Your part: `assess_task` judges whether YOUR body can do YOUR part of this task, not whether
the flock can do all of it. If no part of it is for this body, say so with `tell` and then call
`declare_success` once the others have told you they are done: answering `infeasible` for a
part that was never yours ends your run for nothing. Tell the others before you declare, either
way.
