"""The capability term: a robot bids only for a role its manifest can fill (ADR-0020).

Names are compared canonically, so a robot that provides `observe` satisfies a role that
requires `get_frame`. Both the member (before bidding) and the coordinator (before
counting a bid) apply the same check; the second is defence in depth for the day bids
arrive over a LAN from a robot we do not run.

A v2 role can also ask for a body rather than a vocabulary: enough payload, enough reach, a
gripper rather than a beak. That half is `missing_needs` in `quackd/verdict.py`, where the
same words are read by the pilot's own verdict, so a role and a refusal say the same thing
(ADR-0032). It is re-exported here because this is where the flock looks for it.
