"""One paper trail for the whole flock: every bus message, plan, auction and verb.

`flock.jsonl` is the flock's own log. A coordinator stamps it in sim time (`sim_t`) so a
replay lines up with the world; a pilot flock has no world to line up with and stamps wall
seconds under `t`. Each member gets a real solo-style `Transcript` under `ducks/<name>/` for its
verb events and frames. Per-duck dirs deliberately carry no summary.json — they are not
solo runs and must not masquerade as ones; the rollup lives in the flock summary.
