"""A flock of pilots: one `AgentLoop` per body, on wall-clock time, talking over the bus.

The other kind of flock ([`runner.py`](runner.py)) is a referee and N state machines in one
simulated arena on a lockstep clock. This one has no referee and no arena. Each member is a
real `AgentLoop` with its own provider, executor, allowlist, budget, heartbeat, memory and
feasibility verdict, running at the same time as the others, on any backend, and the only
thing that coordinates them is what they say to each other (ADR-0034).

Three consequences worth saying out loud, because they are the cost of that:

- **Nothing is reproducible.** There is no shared clock, so a seed does not fix a run.
- **Nothing is checked against the world.** The auction vetoes a claimed kick with the
  simulator's own `ball_displacement_m`. Here there is no one world to ask, so the outcome is
  the members' own claims, which is exactly as true as a solo run's.
- **N simulated members are N separate worlds.** Two `microduck:sim2d` pilots cannot see each
  other. A shared arena stays an auction feature.

What this does guarantee: every member ends, every transport closes, and a member that raises
stops the others with a reason that names it.
