"""A task file's `policy:` section, made into the `manipulate` a run offers.

The verb a body registers takes any instruction, and its segment and its timeout are the body's
own defaults. A v3 task file says which instructions the policy may be told and how long each
segment runs, and this is where that becomes the verb itself rather than a sentence in the
prompt:

- `instruction` becomes a `Literal` of the listed instructions, an inline `enum` in the tool's
  JSON Schema, so the executor refuses any other words, the model is shown exactly the list,
  and the stepper can offer each one (`discrete_calls`). An `Enum` class would reach the schema
  as a `$ref`, which the stepper does not follow, so it would never be a choice. A list of one
  is an `enum` of one as well, where pydantic would write a `const` that Gemini's schema
  refuses, and with it every tool of the run.
- `timeout_s` becomes the segment plus `SEGMENT_HEADROOM_S`, plus the wall seconds a
  simulator's clock stands still while its policy thinks (`frozen_inference_s`), which the
  executor's clock does not, held to `FROZEN_INFERENCE_MAX_S`.
- the segment's length reaches the verb through the transport (`set_segment_s`), which is where
  the verb reads it, so the segment the verb runs and the timeout it runs under come from the
  same number. A transport with no setter runs its own segment under the verb's own timeout.

It rebuilds the verb from the one the robot registered every time (`Verb.template`), never from
the last narrowing, so a second task file loaded over MCP is narrowed from the body's own verb
and not through the first file's list. A task with no section, or no task at all, gets the
named defaults and any words. A registry with no `manipulate` is left as it is.

that ends a runner that hangs, and a simulator's bound is what its policy declares and what one
frame cost at connect, times every request a segment can hold: one camera slow to draw at
