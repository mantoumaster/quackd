"""One clock for N ducks: the world advances only when every participant is asleep.

With a single duck, whoever called `transport.sleep()` could just step the world. With a
flock of concurrent tasks that breaks: time would advance once per sleeper and in racy
order. This clock makes sim time a shared, deterministic resource: participants park with
an INTEGER remaining-step count (exactly reproducing the single-duck step arithmetic), an
advancer task steps the world one `dt` at a time only while *everyone* is parked, and due
sleepers are woken in sorted-participant order. The world is frozen while any participant
is awake, so LLM latency costs zero sim time — same semantics a solo run has today.

Rule for participants: every await in your loop must bottom out in `sleep()` here, and you
must `unregister()` when you finish (or you wedge time for everyone else).

The clock asks nothing of the world beyond a time and a way to advance it, so the cartoon and
the MuJoCo world (`quackd_microduck.sim3d`) share it, each at its own `dt`: 50 ms for the cartoon's
kinematics, 20 ms for a walking policy that runs at 50 Hz.
