"""The loop narrates itself: one stream of events, and three views of it.

Everything quackd does on the model's behalf used to happen behind a terminal that printed a
header and an outcome, with the transcript on disk as the only record. This module is the
event stream that record was written from, opened up: the loop, the executor and a wrapper
around the transport emit `LogEvent`s, and sinks render them. The transcript is the record
and always gets every event. The CLI's console and the MCP server's tool results are views of
the same stream, on by default and off with `--no-log` or `QUACKD_LOG=0`. Over MCP the
model is the client, so its reasoning never reaches quackd; there the log shows what quackd
can see: the verb, the gates that fired, every intent sent, what came back, and how long it
took.

Lines are ASCII first. A redirected stderr on Windows turns an arrow glyph into a `?`, and this
is exactly the output people redirect. Colour, not glyphs, carries meaning, and every line is
printed as plain text: a model that thinks `[/think]` must not crash the renderer.
