"""One place that decides what quackd looks like in a terminal.

The CLI grew its colours inline: a `[green]` here, a `Table` there, an emoji in one command
and a dim line in another, with nothing saying which green meant *this worked* and which
meant *this is installed*. This module is that vocabulary in one file, so a new command
inherits the house style instead of inventing a third one.

Three rules run through it.

**Text is data.** A model's reasoning, a robot's manifest and an error naming
``quackd[anthropic]`` all contain square brackets, and Rich reads those as markup: it drops
`[bold]` silently and raises on an unpaired `[/think]`. Everything here takes plain strings
and wraps them in `rich.text.Text`, which never parses. No renderable in this file is built
from an f-string with a tag in it, and the style names are the concrete Rich ones rather
than theme keys, so these renderables also work on a bare `Console` a test just made.

**The terminal is not the only reader.** The same commands run into a pipe, a file, a CI log
and a Windows console whose codepage has no arrow. Glyphs come from a table with an ASCII
half chosen from the stream's own encoding, and the spinner and the status line stand down
entirely when nobody is watching.

**Chrome goes to stderr.** Spinners and the status line live on `err_console`, answers on
`console`, so `quackd list-adapters > adapters.txt` gets the table and nothing else, and a
live region never has to share a console with the answer it is decorating.
