"""A detector whose model runs on the board `--host` names: YOLO on a Jetson's GPU, reached
from the laptop.

The frame is the one the run already has, the primary view that every other detector reads.
It goes to the board as one JPEG, the board's daemon runs its YOLO on it and sends back boxes in
that JPEG's pixels, and the geometry is done here by `detections_from_boxes`, the same function
the in-process `YoloDetector` uses. So the same boxes are the same detections whichever machine
ran the model, and the daemon never has to know quackd's labels or its lens.

Its `detect` is synchronous, like every `Detector`, and says it blocks (`blocking`), so the
verbs and the loop run it in a worker thread (`perception.base.detect_off_loop`): a round trip
to a board must not hold up the event loop that re-sends a walking body's twist. That keeps the
keepalives flowing, and no more: `go_to` holds its last twist for one deadman window
(`verbs.core.HOLD_TTL_S`) and then sends a zero one, so a board slower than that stops the body
between frames, a body with no deadman of its own included, which is the right thing for a
steering loop that has stalled.

Each wait on the board's socket is bounded by `quackd.host.DETECT_TIMEOUT_S`. Two waits are not,
as `HostClient._exchange` says: a name that has stopped resolving is looked up on the system
resolver's own clock, before there is a socket, and is paid again on every call, and a reply
trickled a byte at a time can outlast the timeout. Both happen in the worker thread, and a call
that fails gives its frame no detections.

A board that fails is not a reason to pick another detector. A failed call returns no
detections and keeps the reason in `error`, and the run goes on with this detector: the colour
detector does not label the same things on a real camera, so switching to it quietly would
change what `go_to` steers at with nothing in the record saying so, and the header would name a
detector the run had stopped using. Nor is a frame the board could not read taken for an empty
room: a verb that steers on detections reads `error` after every frame, so `go_to` and
`search_scan` stop the body on the first such frame and fail with the board's reason
(`verbs.core.detector_failed`), and `observe` reports nothing seen, with the reason beside it.

What each call cost is kept too, because whether that round trip is fast enough inside `go_to`'s
steering loop is the question a board has to answer (`bridge/jetson/README.md`): how long the
laptop waited from encoding the frame to reading the answer, and the `ms` the board says it
spent in the model, which splits that wait into the GPU's share and the rest. `take_timing`
hands them over and starts counting again, and the loop's observations and the executor's
`verb_end` write them into the record (`perception.base.detect_times`).

Nothing here has run against a Jetson. The tests drive it against the fake daemon in
`tests/fake_jetson_hostd.py`, which proves the protocol is read as written and says nothing
about a board.
