"""An optional YOLO detector (`quackd[yolo]`) for real cameras and cluttered scenes.

Lazily imports `ultralytics` so the default install never pays for it. Maps COCO classes
onto the same labels the colour-blob detector emits — `ball`, `person`, `pet` — so verbs
and `.duck` files do not care which detector produced a detection.

The box maths lives in `detections_from_boxes`, apart from the model, because the model does not
have to run on this machine: a Jetson reached with `--host` runs the same YOLO on its own GPU and
sends back boxes, and those must become exactly the detections a local model's boxes would.

    verbs have no word for is one they cannot act on. Bearing comes from the box centre's
    horizontal offset through a pinhole lens of `fov_deg`, and distance from the box height
    against `HEIGHT_M`, a typical real height for the label. Both are only as good as `fov_deg`,
    which is why `calibrated` is carried onto every detection: False says the lens was a guess.
