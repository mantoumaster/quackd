"""The seven robots quackd publishes, as data, importing none of them.

`factory.py` builds robots; this file only says which ones exist. The split matters because
`quackd list-adapters` and `quackd doctor` have to render the whole table on a machine where
none of the adapters is installed, and a table that had to import an adapter to name it could
not. Everything here is a string.

An adapter that is installed also describes itself, through the `quackd.adapters` entry point
group, and a third party's adapter is discovered that way and nowhere else. The seven below
are only the ones quackd ships and supports, listed in a fixed order because the tables that
print them are order sensitive and `tests/test_adapters.py` pins it.
