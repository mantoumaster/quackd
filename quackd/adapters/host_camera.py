"""The camera on the board `--host` names, joined to whatever body the run drives.

Any body, because the camera belongs to the board and not to the robot: a Jetson on a bench
with a USB webcam, or the Jetson inside a robot whose own adapter knows nothing about it. The
board's daemon serves the frames (`/snapshot.jpg`), and this module is the one place a body
learns it has them. Nothing else in quackd needs to know, which is the point of doing it here
rather than in `frames_of()`: that has nine callers, and none of them could add `camera` to a
manifest, so `observe` would stay out of the vocabulary of a body that can now see.

Two pieces. `with_host_camera` is pure and changes a manifest: the CLI applies it to the static
one before validating a task file, so a camera task on a blind body is not refused for a camera
the run will have. `HostCameraAdapter` wraps a built adapter the way `LoggedTransport` wraps a
transport, delegating everything it does not add, and applies the same function to the live
manifest at connect.

The rule for which view is primary: the host's frame is primary only when the body has no
camera of its own. A body with cameras keeps its primary, because the bearings are calibrated for
that lens and a Jetson on a bench says nothing about which way the robot faces. The host's frame
is then an extra view named `host`, which the model is shown every step and which `observe`
lists with the others, while the detections still come from the body's own primary lens.

A frame from the board older than `quackd.host.STALE_AFTER_S` is dropped, and so is one that
did not come at all; `camera_error` says why. A snapshot that fails costs the picture and never
the run, which is the Open Duck camera's rule.

`manifest.digest()` hashes the sensors, so a LAN announce of a body with a host camera
fingerprints differently from the same body without one, which is true: it can see. Memory
keys are `adapter:backend` or a registered name, so nothing a robot remembers moves.

Nothing here has run against a Jetson. The tests drive it against the fake daemon in
`tests/fake_jetson_hostd.py`.
