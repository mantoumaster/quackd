"""A ToddlerBot in the cartoon world.

The body is a walking biped with a head, which is close enough to what the simulator already
draws that this needs no new entity. It is `Sim2DTransport` with four differences.

It reports a humanoid's capabilities rather than a duck's, so the adapter narrows the manifest
the same way it would against a real daemon. It refuses the skills this robot does not have,
so a bug that somehow sent one fails loudly in sim rather than only on hardware. It answers
`stand` and the shipped motions, which are the only moves this body has offline. And it stops
reporting a battery, because nothing on a ToddlerBot reports one to Python.

The velocity limits are not enforced here. They live in the manifest, and `speed_limits()`
clamps every twist before it arrives.
