"""A ToddlerBot's own verbs: a neck, a stand, a keyframe and maybe a gripper.

The first full humanoid in quackd, and the manifest is mostly a list of things it will not be
asked to do. Three absences drive it, and all three are upstream's rather than ours.

There is no text to speech anywhere at this pin, so `say` does not exist. There is no walk
policy in the repository - the checkpoint comes from a wandb artifact nobody publishes - so
`move`, `go_to` and `approach_and` exist only when the daemon reports one staged. And there is
no `reset` in the whole sim package, so quackd builds `stand` itself out of upstream's own
default pose, reached at upstream's own reset rate, with upstream's own waist rule first.

What is deliberately not here is a raw joint verb. The body is in multi-turn mode with the
firmware position limits off, `set_motor_target` clamps nothing at all, and nothing reports a
current limit to Python. Handing thirty unclamped radians to a language model on that machine
is the exact failure this project exists to prevent, so the daemon owns every trajectory and
quackd offers named moves instead.
