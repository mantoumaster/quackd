"""The physics simulator behind the `DuckTransport` protocol (`--robot microduck:mujoco`).

The same shape as `sim2d.py` on purpose: one world, one shared `FlockClock` ticking it at
the policy rate, intents mapped the same way. What differs is what a step costs, which is
why the clock's `dt` is 20 ms here and 50 ms there, and why nothing in this module imports
`mujoco` until `connect()`: the extra is optional and the failure names it.
