"""A rigid body arena that keeps the cartoon's rules.

What MuJoCo brings is contact: the ball rolls, a body pushes it, a kick is a velocity on a
sphere the floor slows down. What is kept from `sim2d`, on purpose, is everything a `.duck`
or a test might have come to rely on: the seeded spawn order (duck, then ball, from the same
distributions), the 0.3 s deadman that zeroes a velocity nobody re-sends, the kick that only
connects inside 0.30 m and a ±35° cone, and the scoop that succeeds 60 % of the time because
upstream's is open-loop.

What is not kept is the cartoon's person marker: nobody stands in this arena. The cartoon
draws its person from the RNG *after* the duck and the ball, so dropping it leaves every
seeded duck and ball exactly where it was in both worlds — a seed still lays out everything
the two arenas share. `follow-me`, which is a task about a person, is 2D-only for it.

The duck's base is a `Body`. Two exist: `Puppet`, a kinematic block that moves exactly as
the cartoon does and needs nothing downloaded, and `MicroduckBody`, upstream's real model
walking on upstream's real policy. The world does not know which; it hands the body a twist,
a head pose and the clock's dt, and asks where it ended up.
