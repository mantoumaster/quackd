"""The arena as MJCF text: floor, walls, a ball, and a body dropped in.

The arena is the cartoon's, 2 m across with the same orange ball, so the colour detector that
reads `sim2d`'s frames reads this one unchanged. Nobody stands in it: the cartoon puts a person
marker in its arena and this one has none, which is the single place the two worlds differ and
the reason `follow-me` is a 2D task. The floor, the sky and the lighting are upstream's, taken
from the `scene*.xml` wrappers in `microduck_rl`, so a Microduck here stands in the scene a
Microduck stands in there.

That palette and that detector cannot both have the head camera, which is why there are two
floors and why the head camera renders no sky: see `FLOOR_GROUP`.

Shadows are off unless `QUACKD_MUJOCO_SHADOWS` asks for them. They are upstream's default and
the single biggest render cost once a real robot is in the scene (366 ms per frame against
112 ms with `shadowsize="0"`, measured at 256 px on an Intel iGPU with the Microduck's 431k
triangles), and a GIF of a run needs tens of frames.

Bodies are strings the caller supplies, not files this module knows: the stand-in puppet
below is ours (a kinematic block, for tests and for anyone without the upstream meshes),
and the real Microduck arrives as an `<include>` plus an asset dict from the run-time cache,
with its own licence printed. Everything this module names is prefixed `quackd_`, because
an included robot brings its own names into the same document.

#: Upstream's blue-grey checker is the scene every operator view shows, because it is what a
#: Microduck's own `scene*.xml` looks like. It is also, to an HSV detector hunting a blue
#: person marker, a person: measured off a rendered frame, the floor sits at hue 105 with
#: saturation up to 185 and value up to 229, against the hue 114, saturation 185, value 197
#: that detector calls a person. They overlap on all three, so with only the pretty floor the
#: detector reported somebody standing 0.12 m ahead in every frame of every heading.
#:
#: No person stands in this arena now, and that makes the floor worse rather than harmless:
#: the detector still carries the person target, because the cartoon still has a person to
#: find, so every person it could report from here is a phantom and there is no true one to
#: weigh it against. So the head camera renders the same checker with the colour taken out,
#: and nothing else changes. It is a stand-in and it is listed as one. The honest defence of
#: it is that upstream's blue tiles are a *viewer* texture: the policies that ship with this
#: robot are blind, they never look at the floor, and a real Microduck's camera sees a room
#: rather than a scene file. Group 3 is hidden by MuJoCo everywhere by default, the live
#: viewer included, so only `render_headcam` ever turns it on.
