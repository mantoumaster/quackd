"""MuJoCo's own passive viewer as the `--live` window.

The cartoon opens a pygame window because it has nothing else; the physics world has a
viewer upstream already, with orbit, pan and a contact overlay, so this is a thin hook that
keeps it in step with the clock and turns its close button into the same interrupt the
pygame window raises. Kept out of the default path like `sim2d/live.py`.
