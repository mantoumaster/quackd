"""Two views of the physics world: what the head sees, and the duck from over its shoulder.

Both are free cameras placed by hand rather than the MJCF's own `<camera>` elements. That
is not a shortcut: upstream's `head_camera` carries a quaternion that is not MuJoCo's
viewing convention, so rendering through it looks backwards into the duck's own shell. The
body reports where its camera is and which way it faces, and this module points a free
camera there, at the field of view the detector assumes (`scene.HEADCAM_FOV_DEG`), so
bearings and distances mean what they mean in sim2d.

The head view hides geom group 2 — every mesh of the robot's own shell, and the puppet's
boxes. It is what a camera on the head sees anyway, and it is the difference between 3 ms
and 400 ms a frame with upstream's 431k triangles in the scene.
