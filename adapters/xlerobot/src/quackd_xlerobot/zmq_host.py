"""EXPERIMENTAL: the real XLeRobot, over the ZeroMQ host protocol it already ships.

quackd connects PUSH to the host's command port and PULL to its observation port, and speaks
the flat JSON dict upstream's `send_action` and `get_observation` already use
(`upstream_api.WIRE_FORMAT`). Nothing from XLeRobot is imported: it is not an installable
package, so there is no name here that is not in `upstream_api.py`.

Three properties of that protocol shape this file:

- **`zmq.CONFLATE` keeps only the newest message**, so two sends in one host cycle silently
  lose the first. This backend therefore holds one desired action and re-sends the whole of
  it, so a dropped message is recovered by the next one rather than lost.
- **An action carrying no velocity keys commands zero base velocity**, because upstream writes
  the wheels unconditionally. That is faithfully reproduced: a joint or gripper command zeroes
  the desired velocity, so moving an arm stops the cart, exactly as it would on the robot.
- **Nothing on the wire is timestamped**, and upstream's own client answers a poll timeout with
  its cached frames. This one stamps on arrival instead and calls a reading older than the
  host's own watchdog window a heartbeat failure, which is also how the host's one-hour
  self-termination becomes legible rather than a hang.

Never run against a cart by us.
