"""An XLeRobot's own verbs: two arms' joints, and a gripper that names which hand.

The arms are the first bimanual pair in quackd, and nothing in the manifest vocabulary names
an arm. So the side lives in the joint name (`left_arm_*`, `right_arm_*`, which are upstream's
own keys, `upstream_api.STATE_FEATURES`) and in a `side` parameter on `gripper`. Per-hand
holding lives in `DuckState.extras`, because `DuckState.holding` is one bool for the whole
body.

Positions are normalised, not degrees: upstream's `use_degrees` defaults to False, so a body
joint is -100..100 and a gripper is 0..100 (`upstream_api.USE_DEGREES_DEFAULT`). That is a
different contract from the SO-101 arm in `adapters/lerobot`, which sets degrees, and the two
must not be confused: the same number means a different angle.

The head is deliberately absent. `head_motor_1` and `head_motor_2` exist on the wire, but
which one is yaw and which is pitch is stated nowhere upstream, so quackd does not offer them
and `search_scan` turns the body instead.
