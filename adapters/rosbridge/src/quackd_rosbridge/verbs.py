"""The one verb only a base over rosbridge has: ask the bridge what the body is.

Every other verb here is a core verb, because a Twist is all this adapter sends. This one
sends nothing at all: it reads the topic list and the robot's own description, and refreshes
the datasheet the pilot judges a task against. It exists because `rosbridge` is a name for a
transport, so the honest static answer is "nothing known", and this is how that stops being
true (ADR-0032).
