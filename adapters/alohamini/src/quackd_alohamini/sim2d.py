"""An AlohaMini in the cartoon world.

The base is the one part of this robot the shared simulator already models: it integrates
`vx`, `vy` and `wz` holonomically, which is exactly what three omniwheels do. So this is
`Sim2DTransport` with the parts the world has never had bolted on in memory: a vertical axis
and two arms.

The arms are not simulated, they are remembered. A joint goal lands instantly and a gripper
opens and closes, which is enough to run every verb, every gate and the detector offline, and
honest because the manifest already says `holding` is commanded rather than sensed. What the
simulator does buy is `go_to`, `search_scan` and `approach_and` closing a real loop on a real
frame, which is the thing a mock cannot prove.

The velocity limits are not enforced here. They live in the manifest, and `speed_limits()`
clamps every twist before it arrives.
