"""EXPERIMENTAL: the real AlohaMini, over the ZeroMQ host protocol it already ships.

quackd connects PUSH to the command port and DEALER to the observation port, which is
request/reply rather than a stream: nothing arrives unasked
(`upstream_api.OBSERVATION_REQUEST_REPLY`). Nothing from the fork is imported; every name here
is in `upstream_api.py`.

Four properties of that protocol shape this file, and the first two decide whether a stop is
real:

- **All three `.vel` keys are mandatory in every payload.** `send_action` indexes them with no
  default, so omitting one raises before the lift is touched and before any bus write: the
  whole action is discarded, arms included, and the watchdog is never refreshed.
- **The lift latches, and its two action keys are not symmetric.** `apply_action` runs the
  height branch and then the velocity branch, both unconditionally guarded by `if key in
  action`, so a payload carrying BOTH keys ends with velocity winning and the lift frozen,
  while a payload carrying NEITHER leaves the register untouched and the lift travelling.
  Therefore: to move the lift, send the height alone; to stop it, send the velocity zero.
  `_payload()` is the only place that decision is made.
- **The host exits on its own**, after 6000 s or after an over-current trip that calls
  `sys.exit(1)`. Both look the same from here, so both surface as staleness.
- **Nothing is timestamped**, and upstream's own client serves its cache on a timeout, where
  the cached state starts empty. quackd tracks a sequence and only surfaces a reading that
  actually advanced it.

Never run against a robot by us.
