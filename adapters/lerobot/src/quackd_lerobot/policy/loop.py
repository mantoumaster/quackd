"""The policy loop: one segment of a learned policy driving the arm, paced on the arm's clock.

A segment is what `pick` and `manipulate` hand the arm to. It runs as the backend's policy task
(`LeRobotReal._run_policy`, which takes the segment's first reading, refuses what it must and
sets the step cap), and this loop is its body: a tick at a time, it reads the arm, judges the
reading, takes what the runner has answered, asks it for more, and sends one goal.

**The rate** is the runner's, from the source it names (`Features`), and a rate that is not a
finite number inside `MIN_RATE_HZ`..`MAX_RATE_HZ` refuses the segment. quackd never measures
one: a rate is a fact about the data a policy learned from, and the loop's own pace is reported,
never used to choose it.

**The pace** is the clock's. Tick `k` is due at `start + k * period`, from the integer `k` and
never from a sum of sleeps, so a tick that ran long costs its own tick and not every one after
it. A tick that overruns the next deadline skips to the next whole period after the clock's now,
counts the ticks it missed, and never sends twice in one period. A tick never starts before its
deadline either: the simulator's clock wakes on its own steps, the nearest to what was asked,
and a period that is not a whole number of steps would otherwise wake a tick in the period
before its own (`PolicyLoop._pace`).

**The speed cap** is the verbs' own, `max_step_deg / TICK_S` degrees a second, so the one
setting (`QUACKD_LEROBOT_MAX_STEP_DEG`) governs both. Per send it is that speed over the pacer's
rate, clamped into `(0, max_step_deg]` (`speed_cap`), and the backend writes it on the follower's
config for the length of the segment.

**Chunks.** A request is stamped with the tick it was read at, and the chunk that answers it
holds one action per tick from that tick. When it arrives, the actions for ticks already played
are dropped and the rest replaces the queue's tail, never appended to it, because the newer
chunk saw a newer arm. At most one request is outstanding, and the next is asked for once what
is queued is down to half the last chunk or twice the ticks an answer takes to land, whichever
is more (`refill_due`), so any answer within half a chunk lands with something still queued.
What a chunk can carry is set by the one request out: the next goes out no sooner than the last
chunk lands, so a chunk has to hold twice the latency, and what it falls short by is starved
every chunk (`starved_each_chunk`), whenever it is asked for, which is why `quackd policy
serve` refuses such a latency. A tick with nothing queued
sends nothing (the arm holds its last goal), counts as starved, and `STARVE_S` of that ends the
segment, with `FIRST_CHUNK_S` of grace for a segment's first chunk. Each segment has an epoch,
and a chunk from an earlier one is thrown away.

**The runner's thread.** Every call on the runner goes to a single worker of its own, never to
the default pool the bus's calls run in (`LeRobotReal._call`), so a runner that never answers
cannot hold up a read, a hold or a heartbeat. A segment's reset waits for the one before it,
behind whatever inference is still on that worker, for no longer than `RESET_S`.

**Lockstep.** On the simulator (a clock whose `lockstep` is true) time stands still while
nothing sleeps on it, so a runner's inference is awaited in the loop's own turn and costs no sim
time. Its answer is then held back `k` ticks, `k` from the runner's declared latency, while the
pacer goes on ticking and playing the old queue, and is judged only when it is let go: that is
where it would have landed on the arm, a chunk thrown away and an error raised included.
A runner that answers at once (`k` of 0) is awaited in its own tick on either clock, which is
how a `PolicyLike` has always run: one `act` a tick, its goal sent that tick.

**Tick mode** (`Features.per_tick`): a runner that carries state from tick to tick is asked
every tick, and a tick it never saw, skipped by the pacer or not answered by the next, ends the
segment with the arm held and resets the runner. Its delay line is a tick deep at most: it is
asked again only once it has answered, so one that declares more than a tick to answer could
never keep up on the arm, and is refused on either clock rather than rehearsed on the
simulator's.
