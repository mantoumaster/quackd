"""`quackd policy serve` and `quackd policy check`: a policy in a process of its own.

**This is the first network service whose replies move an arm.** A checkpoint's processors are
code (`upstream_api.PROCESSOR_CLASS_IMPORT`), so no checkpoint and no inference ever run in the
process that owns the serial bus. The user starts this server, in a terminal of its own on the
laptop or on a rented GPU reached through `ssh -L`, the way a board's daemon is started, and
`client.py` reaches it with the protocol in `protocol.py`. It serves a LeRobot checkpoint named
`--policy REPO@REVISION`, loaded and run by `pipeline.py` (`upstream_api.POLICY_PIPELINE`), and
scripted policies (`--policy scripted:NAME`, `scripted.py`), which need no torch.

It is a standard library `ThreadingHTTPServer` in the shape of the Jetson host daemon
(`bridge/jetson/quackd_jetson_hostd.py`), and its bounds are that daemon's, copied here as
named constants because a daemon under `bridge/` never imports quackd and quackd never imports
a daemon:

- **a token, always.** Read from one header and compared with `hmac.compare_digest`. With no
  `--token-file` the server writes one to `~/.quackd/policy.token`, readable by its owner alone
  where the OS allows, and the client on the same machine reads it from there.
- **loopback, unless told otherwise.** A bind to anything but `127.0.0.1` or `::1` is refused
  unless `--behind-tls` says a TLS proxy stands in front of the server: plain HTTP across a
  network would let anyone on it read a frame of the room and change a goal on its way to the
  arm, and the client sends plain HTTP to those two addresses alone.
- **a bound on everything a client can make it hold:** connections, the head, the body, and
  the time a request takes to arrive whole. A request without the token is answered on its
  head alone, and its body is never read.
- **one session at a time.** A reset starts a session and ends the one it replaces, and a
  step for an ended session is refused. A reset from another client is refused while the live
  session is in use (`session_lease_s`), so checking a server an arm is driving through never
  ends the arm's segment, and a client that is done ends its session (`POST /v1/end`). One lock
  guards the policy, so a reset and a step never run it at once, and a step sent twice (the
  client's retry on a stale socket) is answered from the first answer rather than inferred
  again.
- **a slow step holds up nothing but the next step.** A reset is answered at once, even while
  a step its client gave up on is still inferring: the policy's own reset waits for that step
  and runs before the new session's first one, and the old step's chunk is dropped as it ends.
  Another client's reset waits only until the step has outlived its client's patience
  (`ABANDONED_S`). Stopping the server refuses every request after it, and waits
  `CLOSE_WAIT_S` for such a step and no longer, since a step on a CPU can take minutes.
- **no SO_REUSEADDR on Windows**, where it would let a second server bind a port another is
  listening on and answer none of its requests.

`quackd policy check` asks a server what it serves and, with `--bench`, times one step on its
own, then streams synthetic observations at the policy's rate through the real client, and says
the rate it achieved, how often the arm would have had nothing to send, the round trip, and the
latency to declare with `--latency-s`, read at a high quantile of every step it timed
(`LATENCY_QUANTILE`). A rate is only ever measured on the wall's clock, and this is one of the
two places it is (the other is the bench).
