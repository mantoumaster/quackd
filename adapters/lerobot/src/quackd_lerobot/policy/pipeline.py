"""The LeRobot pipeline behind `quackd policy serve --policy REPO@REVISION`.

It runs in the policy server's process and in no other. A checkpoint's processors are code
(`upstream_api.PROCESSOR_CLASS_IMPORT`), so nothing on the arm's side imports this module, and
it imports torch, LeRobot and huggingface_hub only inside `load` and the runner that builds: the
server imports it with none of them installed, and serves a scripted policy that way.

**Loading a checkpoint reads before it builds, and refuses rather than guesses** (`load`):

1. `config.json` and both processor JSONs are fetched at the revision named, and nothing else
   of the repository yet (`upstream_api.CHECKPOINT_FILES`).
2. They are checked. The policy is one of the types whose processors were read at the pin
   (`upstream_api.POLICY_TYPES`), and its features are a state, images and an action. Every
   processor step is named by a registry name read at the pin (`ALLOWED_STEPS`), and a step
   named by a `class` key is refused, so nothing is imported from a path a checkpoint chose.
   A step that could trust a repository's own code is told not to, and a model a checkpoint
   names inside itself, SmolVLA's backbone or a tokenizer, is refused unless `--pin
   REPO@REVISION` says which revision to fetch it at (`upstream_api.TOKENIZER_TRUSTS_REMOTE_CODE`).
   A SmolVLA config that names no backbone is refused too, since LeRobot would fill in its own.
   A pin is a commit or a tag, and never a branch, which moves (`check_fixed`).
3. The rate is `--fps`, or else the fps of the dataset `train_config.json` names, read at the
   revision it names, a commit or a tag, or else the server refuses to start
   (`upstream_api.TRAIN_DATASET`).
4. Only then are the weights, the processors' state files and the pinned models fetched, the
   pinned models with no code and no pickle in what is fetched, and refused if their directory
   holds any all the same or maps a class to code (`check_pinned`). The policy is built on the
   device `auto_select_torch_device` picks (`upstream_api.AUTO_DEVICE`), with every weight the
   file holds loaded into it or none (`build_policy`). An ACT's ImageNet backbone is never
   fetched (`upstream_api.ACT_BACKBONE_WEIGHTS`), and both processors' device steps are put
   where the policy runs and where its answers go (`upstream_api.DEVICE_OVERRIDE`).

Every repository fetched is recorded with its revision (`Checkpoint.loaded`), and the server
says them in `/v1/policy`.

**A step follows upstream's own loop** (`upstream_api.POLICY_PIPELINE`, `LeRobotRunner`): the
arm's reading goes through `build_inference_frame`, named by the session's motors in its bus's
order, then the pre-processor, then `predict_action_chunk` cut to `n_action_steps`, then the
post-processor over the whole chunk at once, and `make_robot_action` makes each row a goal per
motor. One lock holds the three together, so a reset never lands between them, and a reset
resets the policy and both processors. A policy asked every tick (an ACT with temporal
ensembling) goes through `select_action` instead, one action a step. A pi05 that learned
relative actions stays on chunks: its whole chunk is made absolute against the state it was
predicted from, which is how its training made it relative, and not re-anchored each tick as
LeRobot's own loop does (`upstream_api.RELATIVE_ACTIONS`, `VLA_PIPELINE`).
