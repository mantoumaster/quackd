"""The arm's half of the policy protocol: `RemoteRunner`, a policy another process serves.

A checkpoint never runs in the process that owns the serial bus
(`upstream_api.PROCESSOR_CLASS_IMPORT`), so the arm reaches its policy over HTTP, at a server
the user starts (`quackd policy serve`, `server.py`). `RemoteRunner` is that server as the policy
loop sees it: `reset` starts a session, `features` and `latency_s` say what the server said at
that reset, and `next_chunk` sends one observation and returns the chunk that answered it. The
loop calls it on its own worker thread (`loop.py`), so every call here may block, and each is
bounded instead.

**It imports the standard library, numpy and PIL and nothing else.** The arm's process gains
no dependency from a policy: no torch, no LeRobot, no HTTP library.

**What it refuses to take on faith**, because a reply from this server moves an arm:

- **where it is going.** Plain `http://` only to the literals `127.0.0.1` and `::1`, where
  nothing on the network can read or change a reply. A policy on another machine is reached
  through `ssh -L`, which looks like loopback here, or over `https://` with the certificate
  verified. `localhost` is refused with a sentence rather than looked up, because a lookup of
  it costs about two seconds per call on the Windows machine this was written on, and a
  policy is called ten times a second.
- **the path there.** `http.client` follows no proxy and no redirect, so the token header only
  ever goes to the address given. A redirect is an error.
- **the token's secrecy.** It rides in one header. It is scrubbed out of every error this module
  raises, and the URL is held redacted from the moment it is given (`quackd.command`). One a
  header cannot carry, or too short to guard an arm, is refused before anything is sent
  (`protocol.clean_token`), in a sentence that never quotes it.
- **the reply.** At most `MAX_REPLY_BYTES`, parsed with every non-finite number refused, then
  validated strictly (`protocol.py`). A reply whose session or sequence is not the request's
  is dropped, and the loop asks again.
- **the time.** A connect has a timeout, and a whole reply a deadline that every read of it is
  held to (`_BoundedReader`), so a server that trickles its reply is cut off as surely as one
  that stops. A step's is longer than any patience the loop has, so a server that stops
  answering starves the segment, which ends it with the arm held, before the call gives up.

A keep-alive socket the server has closed while the loop was idle is found only when it is
next used, so a call on a reused socket that fails that way is sent once more on a new one.
The server answers a repeated step from what it answered the first time (its sequence
number), so a step whose reply was lost is never inferred twice. A reset names the session it
replaces, which the server takes from this client however recently it was used, and `close`
ends the session, so another client need not wait out the server's lease on it.
