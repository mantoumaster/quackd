"""The policy server's wire protocol: four calls, their messages, and how a number is read.

A policy runs in a process of its own, never in the one that owns the arm's serial bus
(`upstream_api.PROCESSOR_CLASS_IMPORT`: loading a checkpoint can run code it names). The arm's
process reaches it over HTTP with this protocol, the client in `client.py` and the server in
`server.py`, and this module is the one place either of them spells it. A change here is a
change to both.

- `GET /v1/policy` says what is being served (`PolicyInfo`): the policy and its revision, the
  features it wants, the rate it runs at and where that rate came from, its chunking, whether
  it is asked every tick, whether the server has a GPU, the quantiles of the state and the
  actions it learned from, the latency it declares, its threads, how it wants its frames, and
  every repository it loaded, at the revision it loaded it.
- `POST /v1/reset` starts a session (`ResetRequest`): the instruction, the arm's motor names
  in the bus's order, each camera's name, size and rotation, and the session it replaces. It
  answers the session's id, and the one it replaced is over. A reset from any other client is
  refused while the live session is still in use, so a second client never ends a segment an
  arm is driving through the first.
- `POST /v1/end` ends a session (`EndRequest`), which is how a client that is done lets
  another start one at once.
- `POST /v1/step` asks for a chunk (`StepRequest`): the session, a sequence number, the tick
  the observation was read at, the state in the reset's motor order, a frame from every
  camera, and the command the arm last sent. It answers a chunk of actions, one a tick from
  that tick, or null for a policy with nothing more to do, with the session and sequence
  echoed and how long inference took (`StepReply`).

It is not LeRobot's own async inference, which unpickles what it is sent over an insecure
port, needs torch in the client, and skips an observation near the last one
(`upstream_api.ASYNC_PICKLE`, `ASYNC_CLIENT_NEEDS_TORCH`, `ASYNC_SKIPS_SIMILAR`).

**Every number is checked, on both sides.** JSON is parsed with a `parse_constant` that
refuses `NaN` and `Infinity`, which Python's `json` reads by default, and a `parse_float` that
refuses a literal too large to be finite, and every message is then validated strictly, each
number with `math.isfinite` as `quackd/host.py`'s `_is_number` does and never a bool for a
number. A message is written with `allow_nan=False`, so neither side can send one either.
Every list and every string has a bound, and so has every body.

**Frames** travel raw, as the camera's own uint8 pixels, on loopback, where bytes cost
nothing, and as JPEG at the quality the server names on any other link, which is how
`PolicyInfo.jpeg_quality` asks for them. Either way a frame is base64 in its message.
