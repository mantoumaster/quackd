"""A learned policy as the arm's executor: the runners it is asked through and the loop it runs in.

`runner.py` says what a policy is to the arm (`PolicyRunner`, the `Chunk` it answers with), and
`scripted.py` has the runners that need no torch. `loop.py` is the segment `pick` and
`manipulate` hand the arm to. Nothing here imports torch or LeRobot: no quackd command loads a
checkpoint in the process that owns the serial bus, only in a process of its own, and the one
thing that would load one there, `real.load_policy()`, is called by nothing in quackd
(ADR-0048). `server.py` is that process of its own (`quackd policy serve`), `client.py` is how
the arm reaches it (`RemoteRunner`), `protocol.py` is what the two say to each other, and
`upstream_api.py` is every LeRobot policy name either relies on.
