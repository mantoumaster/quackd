"""Runners that need no torch: a Python function answers every request.

`ScriptedRunner` is what the tests drive the policy loop with, what the simulator rehearses a
segment with before a checkpoint is anywhere near the arm, and what a `PolicyLike` becomes when
it is handed to the backend: `ScriptedRunner.wrapping(policy)` asks it for one action per tick,
as `pick` always did. Everything here is deterministic. The same script, asked at the same ticks
with the same readings, answers the same chunks, which is what lets a test say that the
simulator's lockstep and a run on the wall's clock played the same trajectory.

A few scripts have names (`SCRIPTS`), and `named` builds a runner from one. They are what
`quackd policy serve --policy scripted:NAME` serves, so the policy server, its client and the
loop behind them can be run end to end, on the simulator or on the arm, with no checkpoint and
no torch anywhere: `hold` holds the arm where it reads, and `sweep` swings the wrist to and fro.
