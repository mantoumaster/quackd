"""A real arm through LeRobot. Every name verified at a pin, and driven on one arm.

One SO-101 ran this backend on 2026-09-15 (lerobot 0.6.1, Windows 11, Python 3.12.12):
connect, `get_observation`, `send_action`, the two register reads and `disconnect` all
behaved as the rows in `upstream_api.py` say. The arm fell at the end of every one of those
runs, which is why `close()` now returns it to a recorded rest pose first and keeps torque
on when it could not get there.

Every LeRobot name comes from `upstream_api.py` (ADR-0022). LeRobot is synchronous, so
every call runs in a worker thread under one lock with a deadline, and a call that blows its
deadline wedges the transport rather than letting a second thread onto a half-duplex bus.
`stop` re-sends the present position as the goal (hold). quackd disables torque in exactly
one place, `let_go()`, which a person asks for with `--by-hand` and which refuses anywhere but
the recorded rest pose; `take_hold()` is how the arm is picked back up. LeRobot's own
`disconnect()` disables it too, where its config asks, which is upstream's default. quackd
builds the follower asking it not to, and `close()` asks for the release only over an arm at
its recorded rest pose or with none recorded, so an exit that never reaches `close()`, where
LeRobot disconnects the follower as it is collected (`up.ROBOT_DEL`), leaves the arm holding.

What this backend refuses to take on faith, because upstream cannot tell it:

- **the arm is still there.** `is_connected` is the serial port's open flag, so the
  heartbeat reads the arm instead (`up.BUS_IS_CONNECTED`).
- **torque is on.** `get_observation()` reads positions only, so torque state and joint
  temperature come off the bus by register (`up.STS3215_REGISTERS`).
- **the goal is reachable.** A degrees goal outside the calibrated range is written as-is
  (`up.DEGREES_NO_CLAMP`) and the servo clamps it to the limits calibration wrote into it
  (`up.POSITION_LIMITS_CLAMP_GOALS`), so it would be a goal the arm quietly stops short of.
  quackd computes each joint's travel from the calibration file and refuses the goal.
- **the reading is inside the travel.** The clamp is on goals and not on readings: an arm
  folded or placed with torque off can read past its travel, and its recorded rest pose can
  lie there. So the rest move drives to the pose clipped into the travel and judges a joint
  past it as folded, and no hold ever writes a goal for a joint reading past it, because the
  only goal the servo would take there hauls the joint up to the limit.
- **the arm can be told to jump.** `max_relative_target` is `None` upstream; quackd sets it,
  so one `send_action` moves a joint at most `max_step_deg`.
- **one lost packet is not a dead arm.** LeRobot's connect writes torque off and on again to
  every motor, one try per write (`up.CONFIGURE_TORQUE_WRITES_ONCE`), and a Feetech bus loses
  the odd status packet. So `connect()` closes the port without writing anything and tries
  again, a few times, and says each time which joint the bus stopped answering for.

`pick` and `manipulate` run an injected policy, a `PolicyRunner` or a `PolicyLike` object, one
segment at a time in the policy loop (`policy/loop.py`). A checkpoint runs in a policy server of
its own and reaches the arm through `policy/client.py`, whose policy is checked against this arm
before it is energised (`_fit_policy`). `load_policy` builds one in this process instead, and
nothing calls it (LOAD_POLICY, in `policy/upstream_api.py`). LeRobot is imported inside
`connect()` and `load_policy()` only: `quackd[lerobot]` is an extra.

    changes with the register, the value and the transaction result around it
    (`up.BUS_WRITE_ERROR_NAMES_THE_ID`). The id is the servo's address on the bus, which nobody
    at the arm can see; the joint is what they can put a hand on. So the id is looked up in the
    bus's own motor table (`up.BUS_MOTORS`), which is what gave each servo its address, rather
    than read off the order the follower happens to list its motors in today.

    The handshake that opens every connect names its motors differently: a servo that did not
    answer its ping, or answered as another model, is a line `- <N> (...)` in a list
    (`up.HANDSHAKE_NAMES_THE_ID`). That is the servo that stopped answering, or the cable to it
    that came out, which is the failure a further attempt will not fix and the one the person
    most needs sent to the right joint for, so the first id listed is read the same way.

    `name` is the joint, and `label` is the joint with its id, `<joint> (id <N>)`, for the
    sentence that also quotes LeRobot. An id the table does not know is still worth saying, and

    several servos at once and a port that will not open is about none, and a guess would send
    somebody to the wrong cable.

    Nor does a handshake that found no motor of the arm at all (`_every_motor_missing`). That
    is what a servo supply switched off looks like, the state an arm is in after the power cut
    a session ends on, and a cable out between the board and the first servo looks the same.

        would put two talkers on that bus, so the transport stays wedged until the thread
        comes back, and says so instead. The arm holds its last goal meanwhile, which is the
        one thing that needs no rescuing (`up.NO_CLIENT_DEADMAN`).

        `writes_torque` marks a release's or a take-hold's torque write, which is counted in
        the worker thread as it starts (`_torque_writes`), under the lock, so that no read the

        on the wire before this write is, and a count taken in coroutine code would put it
        after.

        A budget is spent by the bus's time, not the event loop's. The loop's thread can be
        busy past a deadline: a pilot's SDK parsing its first response, or a frame being

        queued one comes back in time and the loop does not hand the queued one the bus, and
        the deadline fired first when the loop resumed: a heartbeat the arm answered in time
        was reported as an arm that did not answer, which ends the run. So what spends a
        budget is time the bus was busy after the call was asked, with the calls ahead of it
        while it waited and then with its own, each from when it was handed to the worker pool
        until its worker came back, stamped on the loop's clock (`_bus`). From the hand-off

        one frees: it spends its own budget meanwhile, and the calls queued behind it spend
        theirs. When the deadline fires it reads those stamps, and a call with budget left
        keeps its place in the queue while its deadline moves on by what is left. A call still
        out when its budget is spent is wedged and refused exactly as before, one that spent it
        waiting behind calls on the bus never goes out, and every timeout says which call it
        was and its budget.

        Every call is timed on `perf_counter`, the wait for the lock included, however it ends
        (`Timing`, the state's `timing.bus_call`).

        A call a policy segment was cancelled in the middle of is waited for before the check,
        here and once the lock is this call's, inside this call's own budget, as a call ahead
        of it on the lock would be (`_outwait_segment_call`), rather than refused on: it is the
        segment's own read or send, and the stop that cancelled it is no bus that stopped
        answering. That call holds the bus while it is out, so waiting for it spends this

        `configure()`, which switches torque off on every motor, writes its settings, and
        switches it back on, a `Torque_Enable` and a `Lock` write per motor and each tried once
        (`up.CONFIGURE_TORQUE_WRITES_ONCE`). One status packet lost in any of those fails the
        attempt with the port still open, and every later `connect()` is then refused as
        already connected (`up.SO_CONNECT_REFUSES_WHILE_OPEN`). So between attempts the port is
        closed through the bus with `disable_torque` False (`_close_port`), which writes nothing
        to any motor. The follower's own `disconnect()` would first switch torque off on every
        motor again: two more writes per motor on the bus that has just lost one, each able to
        fail the same way, and dropping the motors the failed attempt had just re-energised. The
        next attempt's `configure()` leaves every motor's torque where any connect leaves it.

        Never tried again: a call that blew its deadline, because its thread is still on the
        wire and `_call` has wedged the transport (a retry would only be refused, and a second
        talker on a half-duplex bus is how packets get lost), and quackd's own refusal of a
        wedged transport. The cameras opened before this and stay open across attempts: they
        are not on the serial bus, and reopening one costs its warmup for nothing.

        Each retry is said twice over, as a WARNING while it happens and in `connect_notes`
        for whoever narrates the session afterwards. When every attempt fails, the port is
        closed the same way, the cameras are let go of, and the refusal carries LeRobot's own
        words, the joint they name, whether the arm may be left half energised, and what to
        check.

        "May be left half energised" is kept across the attempts (`split`), because a later
        attempt that fails before it writes anything leaves the motors as the earlier one left
        them. An attempt can have written torque when it failed on a write, inside
        `configure()`, or somewhere nothing can place; one whose port never opened, or that
        failed in the handshake or the calibration check before `configure()`, wrote nothing
        (`may_have_written_torque`). A connect that ends on a timeout says it too, whatever came
        before: an attempt still on the wire is somewhere in the handshake, the calibration
        check or `configure()`, and nothing says which, and one LeRobot timed out itself could
        have been in any of them.

        A stop asked for while the attempts fail ends them (`set_stop_check`). It is looked
        for once an attempt has failed and its port is closed, and throughout the pause before
        the next, and a stop found there refuses the connect on the spot with the cameras let go
        of, rather than making another attempt, each of which is a `configure()` that switches
        torque off every motor and on again, for a person who has just asked for things to

        The follower is built asking to keep torque (`_config_kwargs`), so an exit that never

        short *inside* its travel, against a hand or the desk, is still a miss and still keeps
        torque.

        An arm still limp in somebody's hands is the one case where neither of those notes is
        true, and it says so in its own words, from what a read of the torque register since the
        release found: every motor off is an arm with no torque to keep and nothing to keep it
        from (`LIMP_IN_HAND`), and motors still on are named, with the switch as what lets go of
        them (`still_holding_in_hand`). And where no read has answered since the release went
        out, a release that raised part way, one a Ctrl-C landed on, or one whose read-back
        failed, and the close's own read made none or was refused, it says exactly that
        (`UNREAD_IN_HAND`): the release went out, nothing read it back, so hold the arm as
        though nothing holds it and cut its power to be sure. "Nothing is holding it up" there
        would be the unread claim, over motors that may still hold. After a take-hold that was
        refused once its torque write went out, the same silence is an arm that may be
        energised, and it is said that way (`UNCONFIRMED_IN_HAND`). And an arm the placing
        release let go of at its rest pose that this close reads still there, every motor off,
        is said to be limp at its rest pose (`LIMP_AT_REST`), not in somebody's hands.

        Three more cases say something of their own, because the usual line would tell the
        person something quackd did not do or does not know. An arm that did not answer the
        read the close decides by is one quackd cannot say is holding itself up
        (`TORQUE_UNKNOWN_AT_CLOSE`). An arm whose release a person just asked for and was
        refused is not sent back to that same release (`TORQUE_KEPT_AFTER_REFUSAL`). And such

        at most `max_chunks` chunks when that is, and until the policy is done or something
        stops it when neither is. The segment's body is the policy loop (`policy/loop.py`).

        The segment's first reading is taken inside its task, registers and all, and judged
        before it sends anything, and the `do` is acknowledged only once that reading has
        passed and the policy has been reset with a rate quackd paces. A refusal sends nothing
        and asks the policy for nothing: a body joint further outside its travel than
        `OUT_OF_RANGE_DEG` (`verbs.policy_past_travel`), a hot joint, torque off, or a read the
        arm did not answer. Nor does one of the policy's own: still busy with the last
        segment's inference, a reset that raised, a rate or a latency that is not a number
        quackd can pace (`PolicyLoop.start`). Two segments at once must not each start a loop,
        so the lock covers the cancel of the one before and the start.

        The task exists from before that first read, so everything that stops the arm finds it
        and cancels it, as it would a running segment. Were the reading taken before the task,
        a stop that landed while it was on the bus would find no task, hold the arm and return,
        and the policy would start after it. The read's own call is the segment's, so a stop
        that cancels it there waits for it as it waits for any segment's (`_cancel_policy`). A
        stop that lands before the task exists, while this `do` waits for the lock or for the
        segment before it to end, is counted (`_stop_count`), and that count keeps the segment
        from starting too. So does a stop still under way when this `do` comes, such as one
        whose hold is queued behind the read the executor makes before `pick`: it began before
        the `do`, found no segment to cancel, and would otherwise hold the arm and return with
        the policy started behind it. Either way the `do` is refused, naming the stop. A `do`
        its own caller abandons while the segment starts, an executor's timeout or an abort,

        policy is done, its time or its chunks run out, the arm stops moving under
        `manipulate`, the policy starves, a guard ends it or something else cancels it. quackd
        only says which verb, and holds the arm to its rules.

        It starts with a reading of its own, registers and all, which the `do` waits on: one
        that rules the segment out ends it `refused` before the policy is reset or asked for
        anything (`_start_refusal`). Then the runner is reset, behind whatever inference an
        earlier segment left on its worker, and its rate is read and judged (`PolicyLoop.start`),
        and a runner that is still busy, that raised, or whose rate or latency is not one quackd
        paces ends it `refused` too, as does anything the start itself raises, with its cause.
        Only then is `ready` resolved.

        The step cap is the policy's own for the length of the segment: the verbs' speed at the
        policy's rate (`policy.loop.speed_cap`), written on the follower's config here, in this
        task, and put back to `max_step_deg` in its `finally` however the segment ends, a
        guard, an error, a stop, the verb's own timeout or the close. Put back to the setting and
        never to a value saved at the start, which a segment cut short in its own start could
        have saved as the policy's. `_hold`, `go_to_rest` and every verb's send write the verbs'
        cap again before they send, so no path round this `finally` leaves a policy's cap on a
        verb.

        Each tick's guards are the loop's, on that tick's reading and before its send:

        - **holding** ends a `pick`, judged on the loop's own reads, so a grasp that settles mid
          segment stops the policy the moment it does, rather than leaving it driving the arm
          through the pilot's thinking.
        - **a hot joint, torque off or a dead camera** ends it, with the arm held.
        - **an action that is not a finite number for a motor of this arm** ends it. `_clip`
          would make a NaN the joint's floor and nothing would count it, and a key that names
          no motor would be dropped by the send, so the motor the policy meant is missing.
        - **a joint reading strictly outside its travel** is left out of the action, as `_hold`
          leaves it out, because a clipped goal there is the end of the travel and the servo
          would haul the joint to it.
        - **a goal outside the travel** is clipped and counted (`_range_clips`), unlike a
          verb's goal, which is refused (ADR-0036), and a joint whose goal stays clipped for
          `CLIP_SUSTAIN_S` ends the segment.
        - **a send that fails** is let go `FAILED_SENDS - 1` times in a row, and the next one
          ends the segment, as does a read that fails.

        A segment a guard ends holds the arm where it is before it returns, whoever waits on
        it. When a `pick`'s policy says it is done, the loop keeps reading, and sends nothing,
        for `PICK_SETTLE_S`, because a grasp still closing reads as held only once it has
        settled.

        The loop sleeps on the transport's clock, a tick at a time at the runner's rate
        (`POLICY_HZ` for a `PolicyLike`), and is the only thing that does while it runs: the verb
        that started it waits on the task. Each tick is timed on the wall's clock (`Timing`)."""

        The gripper is left out of that goal on purpose. LeRobot writes only the keys it is
        given, so omitting it keeps whatever squeeze is already commanded: a stop that
        re-sent the gripper's measured position would open a hand that is holding something
        against its own goal, and every failed verb ends in a stop.

        An arm somebody is holding is taken hold of first. Every teardown begins with a stop,
        so this is what a Ctrl-C during the hand-off wait reaches: the arm is energised where
        the person's hand has it, and the rest move that follows can then put it down. Sending
        a goal to a limp servo instead would be a stop that stopped nothing.

        That is the one take-hold a stop makes, and only while nothing has refused one since
        the release (`_refused_hold`). Where `take_hold` refuses, here or at the end of the
        placement wait, the arm stays in the person's hands and this stop sends it nothing at
        all: no second take-hold and no goal. It reports that it held nothing (`stop_error`).
        A second take-hold is what switched torque on without a word under a person who had
        just been told quackd never took hold, once they did as the refusal asked and moved a
        joint back inside its travel. A goal is what a limp servo keeps in its register and
        drives to the next time torque comes on, which is the stale goal the refusal was about,
        and over an arm the refused take-hold may have energised it is a command to an arm in
        somebody's hands. The close that follows says which arm they are holding.

        A joint reading outside its calibrated travel is left out of the goal too. The servo
        clamps every goal to its travel, so "stay where you are" written to a joint folded past
        it arrives as "go to the limit", and the servo does that at full speed: on the bench a
        stop at the end of a run hauled a folded shoulder up out of its fold this way, with
        nothing in the record saying the stop had moved it.

        Leaving it out avoids starting a rise, and that is all it can do: it does not stop one
        already under way. For a joint reading past its travel, any goal quackd writes while it
        reads there is the limit to the servo. LeRobot caps each send to within a step of the
        reading (`max_relative_target`), and a step from a reading past the travel is still past
        it, so the servo clamps it to the limit and drives there at its own speed. A joint that a
        move had started lifting out of its fold is therefore still rising when a stop lands,
        whatever the stop writes to it or leaves out, until it reaches the limit, and quackd
        has nothing that halts that stretch: the power switch is the only stop for it
        (`verbs.ramp_start` says the same of the move). What a stop owes the pilot is to say
        which joints it left alone, which is `stop_skipped`. If that leaves nothing to send,
        nothing is sent and the stop is not reported as undelivered, because it started
        nothing and was never going to halt what it skipped.

        A stop is under way (`_stops_in_flight`) from here until it returns, so a `do` that
        comes meanwhile does not start a segment under a hold that has yet to go out.

        The verbs' step cap is written again (`_verb_cap`) the moment the segment is cancelled
        and gone, before this reads or sends anything, so a hold never goes out under a
        policy's cap. Not before the cancel: a segment still running would send its next goal

        that lands before it, on the read, goes on up with nothing sent, the arm in nobody's
        hands and nothing refused, so the caller can tell the two apart.

        This is the only call in quackd that de-energises a robot, and it is deliberately the
        narrowest one that could do the job. By default it refuses anywhere but the recorded
        rest pose, which is the same condition `close()` uses to decide whether letting go is
        safe: a pose the arm demonstrably holds with no torque on it. Releasing an arm held up
        by torque alone would drop it, and the person asking for this with `--by-hand` has
        their hands nowhere near it yet.

        `anywhere` is the second door, and a person opens it, never a verb or a model: `quackd
        robot release` and the offer a run makes when its rest move missed, both at a terminal,
        both after telling the person to hold the arm, which is the whole difference. It skips
        the two refusals about the pose, the arm being away from it and there being none
        recorded, and releases wherever the arm stands. Everything else is the same call: the
        joints are read first, the release is read back, and the arm is in somebody's hands
        afterwards. It exists because the power switch was the only other way to take torque
        off an arm left holding itself up, and on the bench of 2026-09-23 that was how every
        run that got to its end finished.

        Nothing is said to be released that was not sent. A read that fails *before* the
        release refuses, because nothing has changed on the arm and a person told it is theirs
        would be holding an arm that is still holding itself. From the moment the release is
        sent the answer is `released`, whatever comes after, and the arm is taken to be in
        somebody's hands: a release call that never came back, a read that failed, a torque
        register that said nothing. The alternative reading, that torque is still on, ends
        with `close()` printing that the arm is holding itself up over an arm hanging limp in
        somebody's hand, and of the two wrong answers that is the one that gets an arm
        dropped. `torque_on` on the result says which of those it was, so the command that

        It refuses before any of that, with nothing written, torque still off and the arm still
        in the person's hands, when a body joint reads outside its calibrated travel, because
        nothing quackd can do then keeps that joint where it was put. Writing where it is writes
        a goal past the travel, which the servo clamps to the limit
        (`up.POSITION_LIMITS_CLAMP_GOALS`), so torque would haul the joint to that end with a
        hand on it. Writing nothing leaves the servo the last goal it was given, and after a
        hand-off that is the rest move's, written before the person lifted the arm and possibly
        the far end of the travel from where they placed it: if the servo drives to its stored
        goal when torque comes on, which is the unverified row above, the joint swings across
        its whole travel. This method used to take that second way, a joint past its travel
        left out of both writes, as the smaller motion, and it can be by far the larger. So the
        person is told which joint, where it reads and where its travel is
        (`verbs.placed_past_travel`). `_in_hand` is left set, so everything after this goes on
        treating the arm as in a hand: `_hold()` sends it nothing, the rest move does not move
        it, and `close()` ends on the note for an arm in somebody's hands.

        Every refusal says which of two kinds it is (`HandResult.energised`), because the
        person holding the arm acts on it. One made before the torque write went out, over a
        joint past its travel, a closed transport, an arm that reported nothing, or a failure
        on the way there, switched nothing on: the arm is as the release left it
        (`energised=False`). One made after it may have left torque on, all of it or part of
        it: a register that did not answer (`None`, and no read from before the write speaks
        for the arm once the write has gone out on the bus, `_torque_read_back`), a call that
        raised with the write on the wire (`None`), motors that read on while others read off
        (`True`, with those motors in `torque_on`), or an arm that slipped as torque came on
        (`True`). Only a read that found every motor off after it is `False` again. Every
        refusal that leaves the arm in a hand is kept (`_refused_hold`), and nothing takes hold
        again until the next release.

        "Switched nothing on" is said of the arm, not of this call. A take-hold an interrupt
        landed on after its torque write went out kept no refusal, and a refusal before this
        one's own write says what the reads say of that earlier write (`_before_writing`):
        `False` only where none went out since the release or a read since found every motor
        off. And where this call's own read finds a joint outside its travel with the whole arm
        at its rest pose and every motor off, the person pressed Enter without lifting it out
        of a fold recorded past its travel. It is refused in those words
        (`verbs.unlifted_from_rest`, `HandResult.resting`): the arm is lying in its fold, and
        "in your hands, keep hold of it" would tell them it is up and needs holding.

        The gripper is not in that check. LeRobot bounds a gripper reading into its 0..100 range
        before quackd sees it (`_normalize`, the function `up.DEGREES_FORMULA` cites, bounds
        every mode but degrees), so it cannot read outside its travel, and a goal for it is
        bounded the same way (`up.DEGREES_NO_CLAMP`)."""
