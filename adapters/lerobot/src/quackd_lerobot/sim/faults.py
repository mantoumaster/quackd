"""Faults the simulated bus can be told to have, seeded, so a rehearsal meets the same ones again.

The faults the lab bench found were the bus's rather than the arm's: a status packet lost in
the middle of a connect, a servo that did not answer its ping, a register read that never came
back. The simulated follower raises each of them where the real backend meets it on an arm,
from a function named as upstream's and in upstream's own words, so the backend's code sorts
it as it would the arm's (`real.may_have_written_torque`, `real.motor_in_error`). This module
decides when, and `follower.py` raises them.

A plan is a spec of rates and a seed. Each kind of fault counts its own calls, and the call at
ordinal `n` of kind `k` fails when a draw keyed on `(seed, k, n)` falls under `k`'s rate. So a
fault lands on the same call of its kind whatever else happened around it: never on a count
shared across kinds, which a heartbeat or a retry of something else would shift, and never on
the physics' step, which the clock decides. One more draw from the same key says which motor a
fault that needs one lands on.

The heartbeat is exempt from every fault a rate draws. It reads the arm on its own clock, the
wall's, so how many times it has read by any given call is chance, and a plan that counted it
would put a fault on a different call every run. Its reads take no ordinal and draw no fault.
The one fault it is not exempt from is the arm dropping off the bus (`READ_LOSS`): a pulled
cable fails every read at the lab, the heartbeat's included, and a heartbeat that still heard
the arm would keep a run going that the bench would have stopped. So which observation starts
the loss is seeded, and which caller meets it first, the heartbeat or a verb, depends on
timing. The follower cannot tell its callers apart, so whoever makes the heartbeat's calls marks
them (`Faults.heartbeat`), in the thread that makes them: a context variable would not reach
the worker thread a call runs in.

Nothing here imports anything heavy: a plan is parsed and checked where the run is built,
before the simulator is.
