"""A primitives-only arm shaped like an SO-101, for wherever the real model cannot be fetched.

CI's physics job fetches nothing, and no test anywhere else does either, so the maker's model
is out of reach wherever the simulator is tested. This arm stands in for it there. It has what
the simulator's code reaches into on either model: six hinge joints and six position
actuators carrying the names LeRobot gives the SO-101's motors, a gripper body with a fixed
finger and a moving jaw on a hinge of its own, so that a grasp is possible, and a body named
as upstream names the wrist camera's, so the wrist view hangs from the same name on both.
Everything is a box, a capsule or a cylinder, so there is nothing to fetch and nothing of
anyone else's to ship.

It is shaped like the arm and is not a model of it. Its sizes come from the one figure quackd
publishes about the SO-101's shape, the datasheet's reach, and its joint ranges from the
manifest's own joint limit. Its gripper range, masses and servo gains are its own, chosen so a
joint follows its goal, and none of them is a measurement of an arm. Nor is its travel: the
simulator gives it a generic calibration built from these ranges, never a real arm's file.

Its fingers are the boxes the simulator's scene expects to find on the gripper, under the names
`model.py` gives them, so the contact settings quackd lays over any model reach them here as
they reach the pads it cuts for the real one.

Nothing here imports `mujoco`: this module writes text.
