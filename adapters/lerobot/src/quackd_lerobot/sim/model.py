"""The arm's model inside quackd's scene, and the maps between LeRobot's units and the model's.

`load()` takes either the maker's model, fetched by `assets.py`, or the stand-in arm that CI
uses in its place, and sets it in a scene of quackd's own: the physics options, a table at the
height of the arm's base, lights, three camera mounts and a few objects laid out from a seed.
The arm itself is drawn in greys, however its model colours it (`_grey`), so that the colour
detector finds nothing on the arm and a blob it finds is something on the table.
Upstream's model is the arm and nothing around it (`upstream_api.MODEL_HAS_NO_SCENE`), so every
one of those is quackd's, and each is laid out from the arm's own geometry and the datasheet's
reach rather than from numbers typed in here.

The model's gripper needs one repair to hold anything. Its fixed finger is one printed part
with the wrist housing, and MuJoCo collides a mesh as its convex hull, so the hull fills the
opening the other finger closes into and throws a pen out of the grasp
(`upstream_api.FINGER_MESHES`). The two finger meshes stop colliding, and boxes cut from their
own vertices when the model loads collide in their place: one for each finger and one for the
palm between them. The stand-in's fingers are already boxes under the same names, so the
contact settings that follow reach both models alike.

What a reading means on the model is here too. LeRobot's five body joints read in degrees
and its gripper from 0 to 100; the model's joints are hinges in radians. Each body joint maps
as `q = s * deg2rad(deg - z)`, with s = +1 and z = 0 on the SO-101 (`upstream_api.JOINT_SIGN`,
`upstream_api.JOINT_ZERO`), and the gripper maps linearly over the model's hinge with its
closed end found from the model rather than assumed (`upstream_api.GRIPPER_MAP`).

And so is the calibration a real arm would read. `calibration_path()` walks LeRobot's own
search for a file without importing LeRobot, `read_calibration()` reads one as LeRobot does,
and `generic_calibration()` builds one from the model's own ranges for a run that names no arm,
so the real backend's code finds travel to read either way.

Nothing here imports `mujoco` when the module is imported: `load()` does, when it is called.
