"""The arm simulator's cameras: the scene's mounts, rendered when somebody reads one.

The real backend reads a webcam through three calls, `connect()`, `read_latest()` with no
arguments (`upstream_api.CAMERA_READ_LATEST`) and `disconnect()`, and it makes each of them
from a worker thread, because a webcam blocks. A camera here answers the same three, so the
backend's own camera code, its refusals and its health rows run over it unchanged. What it
shows is one of the scene's mounts (`model.MOUNTS`), named by the url's `?name=`: the index a
webcam is opened by means nothing here and is ignored, and width, height, rotation and the
lens's field of view apply as they would.

Every GL call, making a renderer, rendering and freeing one, happens on the event loop's
thread, the one path proven on Windows, where a GL context belongs to the thread that made
it. So a read from a worker thread hops to the loop to render and waits there for the frame.
It renders only when the frame it holds is older than the world: staleness is counted in
physics steps, and while nobody sleeps on the clock time stands still, so a pilot reading the
same view twice between two sleeps is handed the same frame and pays for one render.

The field of view a url gives, or the detector's default without one, is horizontal, as the
detector measures bearings (`perception.color_blob.DEFAULT_FOV_DEG`). MuJoCo's is vertical, so
the camera is given the vertical angle that makes the requested horizontal one across the frame
it renders, and the horizontal one is what the transport publishes. Shadows and reflections are
off: each costs a render time, and a shadow is a dark patch a detector could take for something.

Nothing here imports `mujoco` when the module is imported.
