"""The arm's physics world: one model and its state, behind one lock.

What the simulated follower reads and writes lives here, in the model's own units: joint
positions and goals in radians, torque on or off per joint, and a temperature per motor. The
maps between those and what LeRobot reads are `model.py`'s. So is the scene; this module steps
it, starts the arm in its pose, and keeps the truth about the objects on the table.

Every access takes the lock. `mj_step` releases the GIL, and the follower's reads and writes
run on the transport's worker thread while the clock steps the world on the event loop's, so
without it a reader could see a state halfway through a step, or write a goal into one. A step
runs whole physics substeps under it and never a part of one.

Torque off makes that joint's actuator limp and leaves its goal register as it was, so turning
torque back on drives the joint to the goal it held before, wherever the joint has fallen to
since. Whether a real servo does that is the unverified TORQUE_ENABLE_HOLDS_PRESENT, and the
simulator gives the worst case, which is the one quackd's take-hold is written against. Limp
means the actuator's gains are zeroed in the model, so each world steps its own copy of the
loaded model: a joint one world let go of is never limp in the next world built from it.

Ground truth is what a rehearsal is checked against and never what the pilot sees: where each
object is, whether the gripper touches it, holds it between both fingers, or has it up off the
table, now and at its peak over the run. `latch()` snapshots it, so a check reads the scene as
it was when the run ended, before any teardown moved the arm through it.

Nothing here renders, and nothing here imports `mujoco` when the module is imported.

        A pose is read off a real arm folded on a real table, and the model's frame is an

        model's fingers into the table and one link into the next. Started there, the first

        drives it back there rather than into the table. The objects go back where they were,
        and the clock starts at zero. A note names the contacts and the joints, because the

        A start still in by more than `START_CLEAR_M` after the settle is refused, with the

        A fold is often recorded past the travel the calibration recorded, and the close's rest
        move cannot follow it there: the servo clamps every goal to the travel, so the real
        backend parks such a joint at the edge of it and judges it by the half-line rule
        (`verbs.reachable_rest_goal`), and the simulator runs that code. The fold the arm

        not, and then every run that moved that joint ended with its rest move stalled against
        the table, the start's settle notwithstanding. So that pose is settled too, on a copy

        The edge joints keep their start and the half-line rule, which is also why the parked
        pose is judged where it came to rest and not with the edge joints at the edge: a
        contact that stops an edge joint short of the edge, on the side of its fold, leaves it
        at rest by that rule, and the close arrives there. Refused where an edge joint came to
