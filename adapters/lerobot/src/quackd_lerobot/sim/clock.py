"""The arm simulator's time: the physics steps only while everyone who is waiting on it waits.

The real backend paces and watches the arm through one clock (`real.Clock`): the verbs' ticks,
the rest move's, the settle before a hold is read back and the policy's own rate all sleep on
it, and everything it measures it measures against `now()`. On an arm that is the wall's time.
Here it is the world's, and the world moves only in lockstep with the sleepers, through the
flock clock the other simulators share (`quackd/sim2d/clock.py`, used through its public calls
only).

Each sleep is a participant of its own. It takes a fresh id, parks under it for the time it
asked for, and unregisters it as it wakes, so the flock clock's rule does the rest: time runs
while every sleeper is parked and stops the moment any of them is awake. Nobody sleeping is
nobody registered, so time stands still. A pilot's thinking, a verb's reads and writes and a
lone task's work between two sleeps therefore cost no sim time at all, and two tasks sleeping at
once both reach their wake-up, however their sleeps overlap. The ids are numbered in the order
the sleeps arrive and zero-padded, so the flock clock's sorted wake order is arrival order.

One id for the whole arm, as the Microduck has one per duck, cannot serve it: two tool calls
over MCP are two tasks, the flock clock refuses two tasks sleeping under one id, and a single
gate that one task holds while the others ride along on it freezes the riders.

Nothing here imports `mujoco`: the world does, and the flock clock is imported when a clock is
built, inside the transport's `connect()`.
