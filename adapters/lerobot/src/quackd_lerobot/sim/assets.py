"""The SO-101's MuJoCo model, fetched at run time and never shipped.

TheRobotStudio's SO-ARM100 is Apache-2.0, so unlike the Microduck's model nothing in its
licence keeps these files out of quackd. They stay out anyway, because every upstream asset
does (CONTRIBUTING.md): what travels in the wheel and the repository is a commit hash and a
sha256 per file (`upstream_api.FILES`). The first run that needs the model fetches each file
on its own from raw.githubusercontent at the pinned commit, rather than the repository's
archive, because GitHub puts the repository at about 200 MB and these files are 16 MB of it.
It checks each file against its hash as it arrives, and only when every one matches moves the
set into `~/.quackd/cache/so-arm100/<pin>` in one rename, with the licence notice beside it.

`QUACKD_LEROBOT_SIM_ASSETS` points at the `Simulation/SO101` directory of a checkout of your
own and skips the download. A file there that does not match the pin is a warning rather than
an error, because a newer model is what someone with a checkout may want, and the model is
then reported as not pinned. Line endings do not count as a difference there, because Git for
Windows checks the model out with CRLF. `QUACKD_CACHE_DIR` moves the cache.
`tests/test_lerobot_sim_assets.py` drives all of this with the network stubbed, so none of it
fetches anything or needs the physics extra.

Nothing here imports `mujoco`. This module finds files; whatever loads them imports the
physics, inside `connect()`.
