"""The SO-101 follower, simulated: the object `lerobot:real` drives, over a physics world.

`lerobot:real` reaches an arm through one object, a LeRobot follower, and through that
follower's motors bus for the two registers LeRobot's own observation leaves out. This is that
object for the simulator. It carries exactly the surface the real backend touches, the one
`FakeArm` in `tests/test_lerobot_adapter.py` carries, so the connect retries, the travel read
off a calibration, the refusals past it, the rest move, the hold, the release and the
take-hold all run over it unchanged. And it behaves under that surface as the arm does. Part of
that is LeRobot's code, and part is the servo's firmware, which LeRobot's source cannot show,
and a follower that did only what the source says would get the firmware's part wrong:

- **Units.** A body joint reads in degrees and the gripper from 0 to 100, through the
  calibration's ticks exactly as LeRobot converts them (`up.DEGREES_FORMULA`,
  `up.DEGREES_NO_CLAMP`): every reading is a whole encoder tick, the degrees are unbounded and
  the gripper is bounded. `model.py`'s maps then put LeRobot's units on the model.
- **The step cap.** Each send is capped at `config.max_relative_target` from the present
  reading, read off the config as the send is made, by a copy of LeRobot's own function
  (`ensure_safe_goal_position`), its two errors included.
- **The firmware clamp.** The goal is then clamped to the calibrated travel, silently, as the
  servo clamps it (`up.POSITION_LIMITS_CLAMP_GOALS`). A reading is not, so an arm folded or
  started past its travel reads past it.
- **A limp joint's goal.** A goal written to a joint with torque off is kept, and the joint
  drives to it when torque comes back on: the worst case of `up.TORQUE_ENABLE_HOLDS_PRESENT`,
  which the world gives.
- **Only the keys given.** A send writes the goals it names and leaves every other joint's
  standing, which is what lets a hold leave the gripper's squeeze alone.
- **The disconnect.** It drops torque when `config.disable_torque_on_disconnect` says so at the
  moment it runs (`up.SO_DISCONNECT_READS_ITS_CONFIG_LATE`), and a follower collected while
  still connected is disconnected by the same flag, as LeRobot's is (`up.ROBOT_DEL`). What the
  flag starts at is the real backend's to say, so the config has no default for it.
- **The connect.** It opens the port, runs the handshake, and configures, which switches torque
  off on every motor and back on. When either of the last two raises, the port stays open, and
  every connect after it is refused as already connected until the port is closed through the
  bus (`up.SO_CONNECT_REFUSES_WHILE_OPEN`), which is what the real backend's retry does.

The faults a bus can be told to have are `faults.py`'s to draw, and they are raised here, from
functions named as upstream's and in upstream's words, so the real backend reads each one as it
would the arm's.

Every read and write holds the world's lock while it touches the world and no longer. Nothing
here steps the physics or renders: a call here is a transaction on the bus, and time is the
clock's. Nothing here imports `mujoco`, and nothing imports LeRobot at all: LeRobot needs
Python 3.12 and torch, and the simulator runs without either.
