"""`lerobot:mujoco`: the real backend, driving a simulated SO-101.

`LeRobotSim` is `LeRobotReal` with two things changed underneath it and nothing above. Its two
builders return the simulated follower (`follower.py`) and the scene's cameras (`camera.py`)
where the real backend's return LeRobot's, and its clock is the world's (`clock.py`) where the
real one's is the wall's. Every line in between is the real backend's own: the connect and its
retries, the travel read off a calibration and the refusals past it, the rest move, the hold,
the release and the take-hold, the close and what it says. A task file rehearsed here runs
through the code that will drive the arm in the lab, which is the point of rehearsing it.

What it adds is what an arm has and a model does not:

- **A world and its lifecycle.** `connect()` loads the model, lays out the scene from the seed,
  starts the arm at its rest pose, settled clear of the table and of itself where the pose, or
  the pose the close parks it in at the edge of its travel, puts it into either
  (`ArmWorld.settled`, which the rest move then drives back to, and to the edge of the travel
  where a settled angle is past it) and refused where settling cannot clear it, builds the
  clock and renders once on the event loop, so a machine that cannot draw the cameras says so
  at connect rather than at the first frame.
  `close()` stops the clock and frees every renderer, the viewer and the world on the loop.
- **Which calibration.** The file `--address` names, or for a named robot the one LeRobot
  would find under that name. A bare `--robot lerobot:mujoco` names no arm, and quackd's
  default id for an arm nobody named (`DEFAULT_ID`) would find whatever arm this machine last
  calibrated under it, so it gets the generic arm instead, whose travel is the model's own, and
  says so.
- **A person's hands.** Nobody is there to place a released arm, so a take-hold first lets
  gravity act on it (`PLACE_SETTLE_S`) and meets whatever pose physics left: the arm falls, and
  the take-hold's refusals for a slip or a joint past its travel are rehearsed as they happen.
  A close over an arm still in a hand lets it settle the same way.
- **The truth.** `sim_world` is where every object on the table is, now and at its peak, and
  `stop()` and `go_to_rest()` latch it on their way in, before a teardown moves anything. It is
  never in the state's extras, which reach the pilot and MCP. The attribute is not `world`,
  which the core reads as a world to record a GIF of.

Nothing here imports `mujoco` when the module is imported: `make()` builds this without the
physics extra installed, and `connect()` is where it is needed, and where a machine without it
is told which extra to install, before anything is fetched.

        The recorded fold on such a joint is a pose the model cannot hold, so a rest move
        driving back to it pushes the arm into the table, stalls, and every close after time
        has passed leaves torque on. The settled angle is where the arm started and what it
        holds. Inside the travel the joint is judged by the point rule there, because past it
        lies the table and not a fold the half-line rule could let the arm settle toward. A
        joint settled past its travel is parked at the edge of it and judged by the half-line
        rule there, as a recorded pose past its travel is, and the world settled the parked
        pose so that the joints beside it are clear there. The gripper is never in a rest goal,
        settled or not."""
