"""quackd's ToddlerBot daemon: the fifty hertz loop, and everything upstream does not do.

ToddlerBot has no network API of any kind. No socket, no daemon, no IPC: it is a Python
library whose control loop opens serial ports in-process. So quackd ships this, the way it
ships one for the Open Duck Mini, and it runs on the robot in upstream's own environment.

It exists for two reasons, and the second is the important one.

**A verb is episodic and this robot is not.** `RealWorld.step()` is a no-op, so nothing times
out and nothing re-arms: the last commanded pose is held forever. A humanoid frozen mid-stride
while a language model thinks is a humanoid on the floor, so the loop has to run continuously
and quackd's intents only nudge what it is doing.

**Upstream protects nothing, and its shutdown drops the robot.** Verified at the pinned commit:
`set_motor_target` clamps nothing and never reads the joint limits that exist; the motors are
in multi-turn mode so the firmware limits are off too; there is no watchdog, no timeout, no
e-stop and no reset anywhere; a dropped packet returns an all-zeros observation that looks
exactly like every joint at zero; a controller fault surfaces as a bare `KeyError`; and a C
level `atexit` handler disconnects every client on any normal interpreter exit, which disables
torque and drops a standing robot. There is no Python signal handler anywhere upstream, so
`SIGTERM` does not even reach that.

So this daemon carries ten things upstream has not got:

1. signal handlers that reach a safe pose before anything is allowed to exit, and excepthooks
   for the same reason: upstream's C level atexit disables torque on any interpreter exit;
2. a hard-exit timer around `close()`, which is bound without releasing the GIL and can block
   forever on an unresponsive bus, freezing every thread that might have supervised it;
3. a safe-pose slew, since no reset exists: upstream's own default pose at upstream's own
   0.3 rad/s, waist first, because a position command here is a full-torque snap;
4. no command at all until it has read the robot once, because before that the target is a
   guess and writing a guess to a servo bus is a full-scale jump;
5. a last-known-good observation cache with an all-zeros detector, so a dropped packet cannot
   be mistaken for a reading;
6. its own clamp against the joint limits, a per-tick rate limit, and a refusal of any target
   that is not a finite number, since `json.loads` accepts a bare NaN;
7. a control loop that survives a raising tick instead of dying quietly while the socket goes
   on answering healthy;
8. keyframe playback paced to what the body can actually follow, rather than advancing a frame
   per tick and tracing a smoothed shortcut through the motion;
9. a construction watchdog, because the constructor busy-waits forever on a silent IMU with
   the motors already live;
10. capability dispatch by type rather than by testing whether a name contains "real".

Rules this file lives by, the same three as `bridge/open_duck/`:

- **It never imports quackd.** quackd's dependencies do not belong on a robot.
- **It ships in the sdist and never in the wheel**, so `packages` stays `["quackd"]`.
- **It is testable with no hardware.** Everything above the `Robot` boundary is pure and takes
  plain arrays, and `--fake` runs the whole daemon and protocol against a simulated body.
