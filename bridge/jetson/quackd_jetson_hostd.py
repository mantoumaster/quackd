"""quackd's daemon for an NVIDIA Jetson: the board's camera, its GPU and its health, over HTTP.

quackd never runs on the board. It runs on the laptop, `--host` names the Jetson, and this is
what answers there. It gives quackd three things a model server cannot: a frame from a camera
on the board, detections computed on the board's GPU, and the board's own facts (its model,
its L4T release, its memory and swap, its power mode, one `tegrastats` line). The fourth thing
the board offers, the language model on its GPU, is your own model server (Ollama and the
like), which quackd reaches through the same `--host`.

It parses nothing. `/board` ships raw file text and raw command output, and quackd reads them
with the parsers `quackd doctor` already has, so there is one parser to fix and it lives where
the tests are.

**It cannot move a robot.** There is no control path in this file: it reads a camera, runs a
detector on the JPEGs it is sent, reads five files and runs two read-only commands. When the
board is also a robot's own computer, the robot's daemon owns the body, and this process is
the one to lose first; the systemd unit beside this file says so to the kernel.

Rules this file lives by, the same as the other daemons under `bridge/`:

- **It never imports quackd.** quackd's dependencies do not belong on the board.
- **Python 3.10 and the standard library at import.** JetPack 6's system python is 3.10, and
  that python is the one with an OpenCV built against GStreamer, which the CSI camera needs.
  OpenCV, Pillow, torch and ultralytics are imported where they are used, and a board without
  one of them says so in `/hello` instead of failing to start.
- **It is testable with no board.** Every file is read relative to a board root, `--camera
  fake` paints a scene quackd's own colour detector can see, and the tests drive the real
  server in-process with a fake ultralytics.

    python quackd_jetson_hostd.py --camera fake --no-detect      # any laptop, no camera, no GPU
    python quackd_jetson_hostd.py --camera csi --token-file /etc/quackd/jetson-hostd.token

Nothing here has been run on a Jetson by this project.
