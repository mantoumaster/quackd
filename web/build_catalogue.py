"""Write `web/src/catalogue.js` from `quackd/agent/providers/catalogue.py`.

The browser demo needs the model list, and it cannot import Python. So there are two copies of
it, and the only safe number of hand-maintained copies is one: this generates the second from
the first, and `tests/test_web.py` fails if the committed file is not what `render()` produces.
That is the same bargain `test_the_browser_pins_the_same_upstream_commits_python_does` already
strikes for the upstream pins, paid by a script instead of by hand.

Every vendor in `CLOUD_NAMES` is emitted, including the ones the page cannot offer. The page
decides what to put in its dropdown in `web/src/providers.js`; this file decides nothing, so the
data stays one to one with Python and a vendor that becomes callable from a browser later is a
change in one place.

    python web/build_catalogue.py

Stdlib only, like `web/serve.py` beside it. `quackd.agent.providers.catalogue` imports nothing
but the standard library either, so this runs without the vendor SDKs installed.
