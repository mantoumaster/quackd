 * Two things can drive this robot and both are always live. The keyboard writes a twist —

 * has. quackd's switch adds a layer above that: a model reads an English sentence and picks
 * from the robot's own verbs, and the executor checks each one against a contract before
 * anything moves. Underneath there are two learned policies — one stands the duck up, one
 * walks it — and a scripted kick that is quackd's own, not a policy. None of it reads
 * English. That is what the switch is for, and it is the only thing the switch decides:
 * turning it off does not take the keyboard away, because the keyboard was never the layer.
