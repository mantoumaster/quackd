"""Cut quackd's mark out of the duck, and write the two transparent exports of it.

    uv run python web/make_mark.py                  # needs a quackd-web checkout beside this one
    uv run python web/make_mark.py --source PATH    # or point it at duck-source.png yourself

The mark is the duck's head, and it is not drawn here or anywhere else in this repository. The
only original is `src/assets/duck-source.png` in quackd-web, 1086x1448 of rendered 3D duck on
an opaque near-white plate, and every head crop is a derivative of it. Two of those crops were
committed here with the bottom of the head sliced off at the image boundary, taking the chin,
the lower jaw and the orange mouth with them, and nothing recorded how to make them again.
This is that recipe.

The framing is deliberately the old one. The 0.9 export mapped one mark pixel to 2.357 source
pixels, which is a 603x603 window, and that number is recovered by measuring the dark visor
panel in both images rather than copied from a note. The window is kept at 603 and only moved:
the head is 550x553, so it always fit, and the old export had simply placed the window twenty
rows too high. Keeping the scale means the mark's weight on the README and on the social card
does not change, only the part that was missing.

Three things are cut away, each for its own reason. The body, because this is a head, and the
neck is where they join. The heart speech bubble, because it is the duck being pleased about
something rather than part of its face, and it is a separate region so it lifts out cleanly.
The stub of dark neck the body cut leaves hanging under the jaw, because a mark should end at
the chin and not at a tube.

Transparency is a flood fill from the corner rather than a test for whether a pixel is white,
which would have punched out the eye. The downsample is premultiplied, so the near-white the
duck was rendered against cannot creep back in as a pale fringe around the edge.

`assets/apple-touch-icon.png` is not written here. Its head was already whole, and it sits on
a lavender plate this script has no business redrawing.
