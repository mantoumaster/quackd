"""Cut `docs/assets/lerobot.gif` and draw `docs/assets/lerobot-what-it-saw.png`.

    uv run python docs/assets/lerobot_hero.py --video PATH   # the phone recording
    uv run python docs/assets/lerobot_hero.py --run PATH     # the run directory

Both outputs come from one afternoon: 2026-09-15, run `20260915-145349-goal`, an SO-101
follower arm on `lerobot:real` told *wave to the camera with an extended arm* and piloted by
OpenAI's `gpt-6-astra`. The GIF is a phone pointed at the bench. The PNG is three of the ten
webcam frames the model itself was sent, which is a different picture of the same minute: one
shows what the arm did, the other shows what the pilot had to go on.

Neither input is in this repository and neither ever will be. The phone video is 23 MB and the
run directory is 3 MB of PNGs and a 70 KB transcript, all of it on the machine that drove the
arm, beside the other eleven runs of that afternoon. So this script is reproducible there and
nowhere else, which `docs/assets/README.md` says in the row for each file. What is committed is
the output and the recipe.

**The GIF is the one file in `docs/assets` allowed over the general 2048 KB cap**, and it has a
cap of its own here, named in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`'s exclude and checked by
`tests/test_pypi_readme.py`. The reason is what it is a picture of. A render spends bytes on
what moved and nothing on the rest, so the simulator hero fits in 1441 KB at 579 px. A
photograph spends them on every pixel of every frame: the same nine seconds of bench, at a
width worth putting at the top of a page, is megabytes however it is encoded, and squeezing it
under 2048 KB means either 320 px or throwing away two thirds of the wave. Neither is a hero.
Every other asset here stays under the general cap.

Encoding choices, all of them the cap talking rather than taste. Bayer dither rather than error
diffusion, because the pattern is stable frame to frame and a diffused one re-dithers every
frame and inflates the file by about a third. `stats_mode=diff` so the palette is chosen from
what moves, which is the arm rather than the wall behind it. `diff_mode=rectangle` so each
frame stores the box that changed. A light `hqdn3d`, because sensor noise in a dim lab is
motion as far as the encoder is concerned and it is the most expensive thing in the file.
